  abstract = {High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBCL-DH-BCL2), or "double-hit lymphoma," has been associated with a high risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse. However, historic estimates are impacted by selection bias. We report CNS relapse rates associated with HGBCL-DH-BCL2 from a population-based cohort with complete fluorescence in situ hybridization testing, as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma morphology (DLBCL) tumors expressing the dark-zone gene expression signature (DZsig), which was originally derived from HGBCL-DH-BCL2. The 2-year CNS relapse risk in HGBCL-DH-BCL2 was 6.8\%. CNS relapses were early, predominantly leptomeningeal (73\%), and co-occurred with systemic relapse (64\%). High-risk CNS International Prognostic Index (CNS-IPI) and concordant bone marrow involvement were associated with an elevated CNS relapse risk in HGBCL-DH-BCL2. The "refined cell-of-origin" classification assigned 20\% of DLBCL morphology tumors with germinal center B-cell-like phenotype (GCB-DLBCL) into a distinct subgroup based on DZsig expression (DZsig+). CNS relapse risk in DZsig+ (2 year: 6.4\%) was independent of HGBCL-DH-BCL2 status and was further stratified by the CNS-IPI. CNS relapse in DZsig-negative GCB-DLBCL was rare (2-year risk, 1.4\%; P~=~.04 vs DZsig+) and exclusively parenchymal. Altogether, the CNS relapse risk in HGBCL-DH-BCL2 is lower than previously reported, and DZsig refines risk stratification in GCB-DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Molecular heterogeneity of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) underlies the variable outcomes achieved with immunochemotherapy. However, outcomes of gene expression profiling (GEP)-defined molecular subgroups in a real-world DLBCL population remain unknown. Here we examined the prevalence and outcomes of molecular subgroups in an unselected population of 1149 patients with de novo DLBCL in British Columbia, Canada. Evaluable biopsies were profiled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry, and digital GEP to assign cell-of-origin and the so-called "double-hit signature" (DHITsig)-a signature originally described as being characteristic for high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBCL-DH-BCL2). DHITsig was expressed in 21\% of 431 germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL and all 55 Burkitt lymphomas examined. Reflecting this latter finding, DHITsig has been renamed the "dark zone signature" (DZsig). DZsigpos-DLBCL, non-DZsigpos GCB-DLBCL and activated B-cell-like (ABC)-DLBCL were associated with a 2 year overall survival of 57\%, 89\%, and 71\%, respectively. 62\% of DZsigpos tumors were negative for HGBCL-DH-BCL2 by FISH, but were associated with outcomes similar to HGBCL-DH-BCL2. A small group of HGBCL-DH-BCL2 that lacked DZsig expression had different molecular features compared with DZsig-expressing HGBCL-DH-BCL2 and were associated with favorable outcomes comparable to DLBCL, not otherwise specified. DZsigpos and ABC-DLBCL had a shorter diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) than GCB-DLBCL, with this metric being associated with outcome. In conclusion, DZsig expression extends beyond HGBCL-DH-BCL2 and captures a poor-prognosis DLBCL subgroup with short DTI, including patients unidentifiable by routine FISH testing, that should be considered for treatment intensification or novel therapies in prospective trials.},

  abstract = {High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBCL-DH-BCL2) is associated with poor outcomes following standard chemoimmunotherapy, prompting dose-intensive regimen use. However, the benefit of intensification is unclear due to rarity precluding randomized trials, and selection bias in retrospective comparisons. In 2015, BC Cancer introduced a provincial guideline recommending dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) for fit patients aged \pounds 75 years with HGBCL-DH-BCL2 identified by routine cytogenetic testing. To assess this guideline's impact, we compared the outcomes of patients with de novo HGBCL-DH-BCL2 tumors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) morphology across two eras. The DA-EPOCH-R era (2015-2020) included patients diagnosed after guideline implementation. The historic era (2005-2010) included patients identified from a historic province-wide cohort of patients with DLBCL morphology tumors that underwent universal cytogenetic testing in a research setting, predominantly treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy. Two-year overall survival (OS) was significantly improved in the DA-EPOCH-R versus historic era (75\% versus 47\%, P=.008) in HGBCL-DH-BCL2, whereas OS remained unchanged in DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS) (78\% versus 76\%, P=.17). Within HGBCL-DH-BCL2, tumors harboring immunoglobulin MYC partner loci (43\%) and those expressing the dark-zone signature (77\%) were associated with the most substantial survival improvements. In a contemporary cohort of HGBCL-DH-BCL2 histologically transformed from follicular lymphoma in the DA-EPOCH-R era, outcomes of chemoimmunotherapy-na\"ive patients were comparable to those with de novo disease, whereas patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy for follicular lymphoma prior to transformation had poor outcomes. These data support using DA-EPOCH-R in select patients with HGBCL-DH-BCL2 of DLBCL morphology.},

Prognosis is strongly associated with molecular subgroup, although the driver mutations that distinguish the two main subgroups remain poorly defined. Through an integrative analysis of whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes, we have uncovered genes and non-coding loci that are commonly mutated in DLBCL. Our analysis has identified novel cis-regulatory sites, and implicates recurrent mutations in the 3' UTR of NFKBIZ as a novel mechanism of oncogene deregulation and NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway activation in the activated B-cell (ABC) subgroup. Small amplifications associated with over-expression of FCGR2B (the Fc{$\gamma$} receptor protein IIB), primarily in the germinal centre B-cell (GCB) subgroup, correlate with poor patient outcomes suggestive of a novel oncogene. These results expand the list of subgroup driver mutations that may facilitate implementation of improved diagnostic assays and could offer new avenues for the development of targeted therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B~cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and remains incurable in around 40\% of patients. Efforts to sequence the coding genome identified several genes and pathways that are altered in this disease, including potential therapeutic targets1-5. However, the non-coding genome of DLBCL remains largely unexplored. Here we show that active super-enhancers are highly and specifically hypermutated in 92\% of samples from individuals with DLBCL, display signatures of activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity, and are linked to genes that encode B cell developmental regulators and oncogenes. As evidence of oncogenic relevance, we show that the hypermutated super-enhancers linked to the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 proto-oncogenes prevent the binding and transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding target gene by transcriptional repressors, including BLIMP1 (targeting BCL6) and the steroid receptor NR3C1 (targeting BCL2 and CXCR4). Genetic correction of selected mutations restored repressor DNA binding, downregulated target gene expression and led to the counter-selection of cells containing corrected alleles, indicating an oncogenic dependency on the super-enhancer mutations. This pervasive super-enhancer mutational mechanism reveals a major set of genetic lesions deregulating gene expression, which expands the involvement of known oncogenes in DLBCL pathogenesis and identifies new deregulated gene targets of therapeutic relevance.},

We reported that STAT6D419~mutations are enriched~in relapsed/refractory DLBCL (rrDLBCL) samples, suggesting that JAK/STAT signaling plays a role in therapeutic resistance. We hypothesized that STAT6D419 mutations can improve DLBCL cell survival by reprogramming the microenvironment to sustain STAT6 activation. Thus, we investigated the role of STAT6D419 mutations on DLBCL cell growth and its microenvironment. We found that phospho-STAT6D419N was retained in the nucleus longer than phospho-STAT6WT following IL-4 stimulation, and STAT6D419N recognized a more restricted DNA-consensus sequence than STAT6WT. Upon IL-4 induction, STAT6D419N expression led to a higher magnitude of gene expression changes, but in a more selective list of gene targets compared with STATWT. The most significantly expressed genes induced by STAT6D419N were those implicated in survival, proliferation, migration, and chemotaxis, in particular CCL17. This chemokine, also known as TARC, attracts helper T-cells to the tumor microenvironment, especially in Hodgkin's lymphoma. To this end, in DLBCL, phospho-STAT6+ rrDLBCL cells had a greater proportion of infiltrating CD4+ T-cells than phospho-STAT6- tumors. Our findings suggest that STAT6D419 mutations in DLBCL lead to cell autonomous changes, enhanced signaling, and altered composition of the tumor microenvironment.},

To address this challenge, we analyzed 92 HGBCL-NOS tumors collected across Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project sites. Leveraging comparison cohorts of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS (DLBCL-NOS) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), and molecular frameworks described in these entities, our analysis revealed a heterogenous molecular landscape, reminiscent of DLBCL-NOS but with an enrichment of BL features. By cell-of-origin classification, 59\% were germinal center B-cell-like (GCB), and 25\% were activated B-cell-like (ABC). LymphGen, a genetic classifier for DLBCL-NOS, assigned a genetic subtype to 34\% of HGBCL-NOS. Although classification rate was lower than in DLBCL-NOS (66\%), assigned subtypes spanned the spectrum of LymphGen classes, including 31\% of ABCs classified as MCD. Features differentiating HGBCL-NOS from DLBCL-NOS included MYC rearrangement (47\% vs 6\%); dark zone signature (DZsig) expression (45\% vs 7\%); and more frequent mutation of ID3, MYC, CCND3, and TP53, all common to BL. A genetic classifier that differentiates DLBCL-NOS from BL classified 53\% of DZsig+ tumors as BL-like, and those classified as DLBCL-like were frequently BCL2-rearranged. Among DZsig- GCB tumors, 95\% were DLBCL-like. Centralized pathology review reclassified almost half of tumors as DLBCL-NOS but did not identify a more homogenous HGBCL-NOS population, with no difference in features between confirmed and reclassified tumors. In conclusion, molecular testing enables a subset of HGBCL-NOS to be assigned to established categories. Based on rarity and diagnostic challenges, broader inclusion of HGBCL-NOS should be considered in biomarker-driven DLBCL trials.},

Unbalanced MYC break-apart patterns, in which the red or green signal is lost, are commonly reported as an equivocal result by clinical laboratories. In a cohort of 297 HGBCL-DH-BCL2, 13\% of tumors had unbalanced MYC break-apart patterns with loss of red (LR; 2\%) or loss of green (LG; 11\%) signal. To determine the significance of these patterns, MYC rearrangements were characterized by sequencing in 130 HGBCL-DH-BCL2, including 3 LR and 14 LG tumors. A MYC rearrangement was identified for 71\% of tumors with LR or LG patterns, with the majority involving immunoglobulin loci or other recurrent MYC rearrangement partners. The architecture of these rearrangements consistently preserved the rearranged MYC allele, with the MYC gene predicted to be on the derivative chromosome containing the signal that is still present in nearly all cases. MYC protein expression, MYC messenger RNA expression, and the proportion of tumors expressing the dark-zone signature was not significantly different between balanced and unbalanced groups. These results support a recommendation that unbalanced MYC break-apart FISH patterns be reported as positive for MYC rearrangement in the context of diagnosing HGBCL-DH-BCL2.},

  abstract = {TO THE EDITOR:Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease identified by morphology, immunophenotype, and a typically aggressive clinical course.1 DLBCL has long been stratified based on gene expression profiling (GEP) into activated B-cell--like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell--like (GCB) cell-of-origin (COO) subtypes.2 Recently, several studies stratified DLBCL into genetic subgroups based on the co-occurrence of mutational features with strong associations with COO.3-6 Previously, our 2 groups independently reported gene expression signatures associated with dark-zone--like biology in DLBCL. The molecular high-grade signature (MHG) identifies DLBCLs expressing a Burkitt lymphoma (BL)-like GEP signature,7 whereas the double-hit signature (since renamed dark-zone signature [DZsig]8) identifies DLBCLs with a GEP signature like high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangement (HGBCL-DH-BCL2) (whether the tumors harbor MYC and BCL2 rearrangements or not).9,10 Remarkably, despite the small overlap in the genes that comprise each signature, both classifiers identified a subset of DLBCL tumors enriched for certain genetic aberrations, including concomitant MYC and BCL2 rearrangements.7,9},

  abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for {$\sim$}20\% of all new lymphoma cases. Increases in cytological grade are a feature of the clinical progression of this malignancy, and eventual histologic transformation (HT) to the aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in up to 15\% of patients. Clinical or genetic features to predict the risk and timing of HT have not been described comprehensively. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 423 patients to compare the protein coding and noncoding mutation landscapes of untransformed FL, transformed FL, and de novo DLBCL. This revealed 2 genetically distinct subgroups of FL, which we have named DLBCL-like (dFL) and constrained FL (cFL). Each subgroup has distinguishing mutational patterns, aberrant somatic hypermutation rates, and biological and clinical characteristics. We implemented a machine learning--derived classification approach to stratify patients with FL into cFL and dFL subgroups based on their genomic features. Using separate validation cohorts, we demonstrate that cFL status, whether assigned with this full classifier or a single-gene approximation, is associated with a reduced rate of HT. This implies distinct biological features of cFL that constrain its evolution, and we highlight the potential for this classification to predict HT from genetic features present at diagnosis.},

Lymphomas with gene expression features of PMBL have been described in nonmediastinal sites, raising questions about how these tumors should be classified. Here, we investigated whether these nonmediastinal lymphomas are indeed PMBLs or instead represent a distinct group within diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). From a cohort of 325 de novo DLBCL cases, we identified tumors from patients without evidence of anterior mediastinal involvement that expressed a PMBL expression signature (nm-PMBLsig+; n = 16; 5\%). A majority of these tumors expressed MAL and CD23, proteins typically observed in bona fide PMBL (bf-PMBL). Evaluation of clinical features of nm-PMBLsig+ cases revealed close associations with DLBCL, and a majority displayed a germinal center B cell-like cell of origin (GCB). In contrast to patients with bf-PMBL, patients with nm-PMBLsig+ presented at an older age and did not show pleural disease, and bone/bone marrow involvement was observed in 3 cases. However, although clinically distinct from bf-PMBL, nm-PMBLsig+ tumors resembled bf-PMBL at the molecular level, with upregulation of immune response, JAK-STAT, and NF-{$\kappa$}B signatures. Mutational analysis revealed frequent somatic gene mutations in SOCS1, IL4R, ITPKB, and STAT6, as well as CD83 and BIRC3, with the latter genes significantly more frequently affected than in GCB DLBCL or bf-PMBL. Our data establish nm-PMBLsig+ lymphomas as a group within DLBCL with distinct phenotypic and genetic features. These findings may have implications for gene expression- and mutation-based subtyping of aggressive B-cell lymphomas and related targeted therapies.},

Current classification incorporates clinical presentation and ALK status, but inadequately addresses molecular heterogeneity and therapeutic vulnerabilities. We studied 689 ALCLs in the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project and performed expert consensus review, genetic subtyping (ALK, DUSP22, TP63, and triple-negative), and immunohistochemistry for phospho-STAT3Tyr705. RNAseq with unsupervised gene expression profiling in a sub-cohort (N=393) identified two main molecular types of ALCL that could be predicted with 91\% accuracy based on the presence (Type I) or absence (Type II) of phospho-STAT3Y705 expression (P{$<$}0.0001). Type I ALCLs included ALK+ ALCL and a subset of triple-negative ALCLs (TN-I); Type II ALCLs included tumors with DUSP22 and/or TP63 rearrangements and the remaining triple-negative ALCLs (TN-II). Type I ALCLs were enriched for JAK-STAT3 (FDR{$<$}0.0001), whereas Type II ALCLs were enriched for non-tyrosine kinase pathways, particularly epigenetic regulators such as EZH2 (FDR{$<$}0.0001). EZH2 and H3K27me3 were overexpressed by immunohistochemistry (P{$<$}0.0001). Prognosis in systemic ALCL was favorable for DUSP22-rearranged ALCL (5-year OS, 95\%; N=49) and ALK+ ALCL (88\%; N=101), intermediate for triple-negative ALCL (TN-I, 52\% and TN-II, 37\%; N=92), and poor for TP63-rearranged ALCL (0\%; P{$<$}0.0001; N=15). We introduce an integrated molecular classification that preserves currently diagnosed ALCL entities but identifies four molecularly distinct ALK- ALCL subtypes (DUSP22-rearranged, TP63-rearranged, TN-I, and TN-II). This classification can be easily implemented on paraffin tissue in routine practice or clinical trials and stratifies ALCL into diagnostically, prognostically, biologically, and potentially therapeutically relevant subtypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene plays a crucial role in determining the prognosis and treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A common approach for determining SHM status is multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing of the immunoglobin heavy locus; however, this technique is low throughput, is vulnerable to failure, and does not allow multiplexing with other diagnostic assays. METHODS: Here we designed and validated a DNA targeted capture approach to detect immunoglobulin heavy variable somatic hypermutation (IGHV SHM) status as a submodule of a larger next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that also includes probes for ATM, BIRC3, CHD2, KLHL6, MYD88, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, POT1, SF3B1, TP53, and XPO1. The assay takes as input FASTQ files and outputs a report containing IGHV SHM status and V allele usage following European Research Initiative on CLL guidelines. RESULTS: We validated the approach on 35 CLL patient samples, 34 of which were characterized using Sanger sequencing. The NGS panel identified the IGHV SHM status of 34 of 35 CLL patients. We showed 100\% sensitivity and specificity among the 33 CLL samples with both NGS and Sanger sequencing calls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this panel can be combined with additional targeted capture panels to detect prognostically important CLL single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, and copy number variants (TP53 copy number loss). CONCLUSIONS: A targeted capture approach to IGHV SHM detection can be integrated into broader sequencing panels, allowing broad CLL prognostication in a single molecular assay.},

Over the last 2 decades, several different approaches for dissecting biological heterogeneity have emerged. Gene expression profiling (GEP) stratifies DLBCL into 3 broad groups (ABC, GCB, and DZsig/MHG), each with parallels to different normal mature B cell developmental states and prognostic implications. More recently, several different genomic approaches have been developed to categorize DLBCL based on the co-occurrence of tumor somatic mutations, identifying more granular biologically unified subgroups that complement GEP-based approaches. We review the molecular approaches and clinical evidence supporting the stratification of DLBCL patients based on tumor biology. By offering a platform for subtype-guided therapy, these divisions remain a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes, especially in subgroups with inferior outcomes with current standard-of-care therapy.},

We recently described a gene expression signature that identifies 27\% of germinal center B-cell DLBCLs (GCB-DLBCLs) as having a double-hit-like expression pattern (DHITsig) and inferior outcomes; however, only half of these cases have both MYC and BCL2 translocations identifiable using standard breakapart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Here, 20 DHITsig+ GCB-DLBCLs apparently lacking MYC and/or BCL2 rearrangements underwent whole-genome sequencing. This revealed 6 tumors with MYC or BCL2 rearrangements that were cryptic to breakapart FISH. Copy-number analysis identified 3 tumors with MYC and 6 tumors with MIR17HG gains or amplifications, both of which may contribute to dysregulation of MYC and its downstream pathways. Focal deletions of the PVT1 promoter were observed exclusively among DHITsig+ tumors lacking MYC translocations; this may also contribute to MYC overexpression. These results highlight that FISH fails to identify all HGBL-DH/THs, while revealing a range of other genetic mechanisms potentially underlying MYC dysregulation in DHITsig+ DLBCL, suggesting that gene expression profiling is more sensitive for identifying the biology underlying poor outcomes in GCB-DLBCL.},

Cilia can be lost by shedding or disassembly, but either way, it appears that the final release may be via a coordinated severing of the nine axonemal outer doublet microtubules linking the basal body to the ciliary transition zone. Little is known about the mechanism or regulation of this important process. The stress-induced deflagellation response of Chlamydomonas provides a basis to identifying key players in axonemal severing. In an earlier screen we uncovered multiple alleles for each of three deflagellation genes, ADF1, FA1, and FA2 Products of the two FA genes localize to the site of axonemal severing and encode a scaffolding protein and a member of the NIMA-related family of ciliary-cell cycle kinases. The identity of the ADF1 gene remained elusive. Here, we report a new screen using a mutagenesis that yields point mutations in Chlamydomonas, an enhanced screening methodology, and whole genome sequencing. We isolated numerous new alleles of the three known genes, and one or two alleles each of at least four new genes. We identify ADF1 as a TRP ion channel, which we suggest may reside at the flagellar transition zone.},

Over the past 25 years, there has been an exponential accumulation of detailed genomic characterizations of these lymphomas. Many defined categories have been confirmed as relatively homogeneous, fulfilling the classification ideal of sharing core biological hallmarks. However, the largest group, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, which makes up 70-74\% of the patients, has been revealed to be remarkably heterogeneous at a genomic and biological level. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge and then propose an evolution of the classification of aggressive B-cell lymphomas to a genomics-informed taxonomy based around normal B-cell development and the different modes by which lymphomas achieve key hallmarks of cancer-hallmarks that can inform on patient management.},

Steady-state length reflects a balance between rates of ciliary assembly and disassembly, two parameters likely controlled by a length sensor of unknown identity or mechanism. RESULTS: A null mutation in Chlamydomonas CNK2, a member of the evolutionarily conserved family of NIMA-related kinases, reveals feedback regulation of assembly and disassembly rates. cnk2-1 mutant cells have a mild long-flagella (lf) phenotype as a consequence of reduced rates of flagellar disassembly. This is in contrast to the strong lf mutant lf4-7, which exhibits an aberrantly high rate of assembly. Cells carrying both mutations have even longer flagella than lf4-7 single mutants do. In addition to their high rate of assembly, lf4-7 mutants have a CNK2-dependent increase in disassembly rate. Finally, cnk2-1 cells have a decreased rate of turnover of flagellar subunits at the tip of the flagellum, demonstrating that the effects on disassembly are compensated by a reduced rate of assembly. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model wherein CNK2 and LF4 modulate rates of disassembly and assembly respectively in a feedback loop that is activated when flagella exceed optimal length.},

  abstract = {Rearrangements that place the oncogenes MYC, BCL2, or BCL6 adjacent to superenhancers are common in mature B-cell lymphomas. Lymphomas with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or high-grade morphology with both MYC and BCL2 rearrangements are classified as high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (``double hit''; HGBCL-DH-BCL2) and are associated with aggressive disease and poor outcomes. Although it is established that MYC rearrangements involving immunoglobulin (IG) loci are associated with inferior outcomes relative to those involving other non-IG superenhancers, the frequency of and mechanisms driving IG vs non-IG MYC rearrangements have not been elucidated. Here, we used custom targeted capture and/or whole-genome sequencing to characterize oncogene rearrangements across 883 mature B-cell lymphomas including Burkitt lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, DLBCL, and HGBCL-DH-BCL2 tumors. We demonstrate that, although BCL2 rearrangement topology is consistent across entities, HGBCL-DH-BCL2 have distinct MYC rearrangement architecture relative to tumors with single MYC rearrangements or with both MYC and BCL6 rearrangements (HGBCL-DH-BCL6), including both a higher frequency of non-IG rearrangements and different architecture of MYC::IGH rearrangements. The distinct MYC rearrangement patterns in HGBCL-DH-BCL2 occur on the background of high levels of somatic hypermutation across MYC partner loci in HGBCL-DH-BCL2, creating more opportunity to form these rearrangements. Furthermore, because 1 IGH allele is already disrupted by the existing BCL2 rearrangement, the MYC rearrangement architecture in HGBCL-DH-BCL2 likely reflects selective pressure to preserve both BCL2 and B-cell receptor expression. These data provide new mechanistic explanations for the distinct patterns of MYC rearrangements observed across different lymphoma entities.},

NEK1 has previously been shown to localize near centrosomes and to play a role in centrosomal stability and ciliogenesis. Recent data suggest that the etiology of kidney cysts involves aberrant signaling from the primary cilium to the nucleus. Here we demonstrate that NEK1 contains functional nuclear localization signals, is exported from the nucleus via a nuclear export signal-dependent pathway and that the protein cycles through the nucleus. Our data suggest that NEK1 is a candidate to transduce messages from the ciliary-basal body region to the regulation of nuclear gene expression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is cured in more than 60\% of patients, but outcomes remain poor for patients experiencing disease progression or relapse (refractory or relapsed DLBCL [rrDLBCL]), particularly if these events occur early. Although previous studies examining cohorts of rrDLBCL have identified features that are enriched at relapse, few have directly compared serial biopsies to uncover biological and evolutionary dynamics driving rrDLBCL. Here, we sought to confirm the relationship between relapse timing and outcomes after second-line (immuno)chemotherapy and determine the evolutionary dynamics that underpin that relationship. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outcomes were examined in a population-based cohort of 221 patients with DLBCL who experienced progression/relapse after frontline treatment and were treated with second-line (immuno)chemotherapy with an intention-to-treat with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Serial DLBCL biopsies from a partially overlapping cohort of 129 patients underwent molecular characterization, including whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing in 73 patients. RESULTS: Outcomes to second-line therapy and ASCT are superior for late relapse ({$>$}2 years postdiagnosis) versus primary refractory ({$<$}9 months) or early relapse (9-24 months). Diagnostic and relapse biopsies were mostly concordant for cell-of-origin classification and genetics-based subgroup. Despite this concordance, the number of mutations exclusive to each biopsy increased with time since diagnosis, and late relapses shared few mutations with their diagnostic counterpart, demonstrating a branching evolution pattern. In patients with highly divergent tumors, many of the same genes acquired new mutations independently in each tumor, suggesting that the earliest mutations in a shared precursor cell constrain tumor evolution toward the same genetics-based subgroups at both diagnosis and relapse. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that late relapses commonly represent genetically distinct and chemotherapy-na\"ive disease and have implications for optimal patient management.},

Here, we describe a self-training implementation of our probability ratio-based classification prediction score method (PRPS-ST), which facilitates the porting of existing classification models to other gene expression data sets. In comparison to gold standards, we demonstrate favorable performance of PRPS-ST in gene expression-based classification of DLBCL and B-ALL using a diverse variety of gene expression data types and pre-processing methods, including in classifications with a high degree of class imbalance. Tumors classified by our method were significantly enriched for prototypical genetic features of their respective subgroups. Interestingly, this included cases that were unclassifiable by established methods, implying the potential enhanced sensitivity of PRPS-ST.},

  abstract = {Genetic subtyping of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been slow to gain clinical adoption. Available classifiers either leave many tumours unclassified or depend on exome-wide features and copy-number profiles, which are not always available in routine practice. We introduce DLBCLone, a neighbourhood-based framework that enables panel-aware genetic subtyping compatible with existing taxonomies. DLBCLone learns a 2-D reference map of mutation profiles (UMAP) from a labeled training cohort, freezes this map, and deterministically projects new cases into the same latent space. Class labels are then inferred by weighted K-nearest neighbours, limiting over-assignment by considering the local density of unclassified neighbours. By default, classification thresholds optimize per-class balanced accuracy, but can be adjusted to suit study needs. The framework is intended to emulate (or ``clone'') existing schemas such as LymphGen or DLBClass. Trained on a harmonized cohort of 2,130 DLBCLs, DLBCLone classifiers for different gene panels achieved consistently improve classification rates relative to fixed-threshold baselines while maintaining a reasonable per-class performance. On an in-house cohort of 323 patients, it assigned an additional 98 samples without compromising accuracy relative to LymphGen. On an external exome-sequenced subset from a 1,001-patient cohort, DLBCLone achieved a 51\% classification rate (vs 36\% for LymphGen) at an overall accuracy of 0.70. Compared with another LymphGen approximator (LymphPlex), DLBCLone reached a 74\% classification rate (vs 55\%). In general, the DLBCLone-reclassified tumours had molecular features consistent with their new labels. DLBCLone provides a deterministic, reproducible, and extensible approach to genetic subtyping under real-world constraints, facilitating prospective studies that rely on either targeted panels or more comprehensive sequencing strategies. DLBCLone is open source and available in the GAMBLR.predict package (https://github.com/morinlab/gamblr.predict).},

Divergent patterns of cell-cell communication underpinned the transcriptional phenotypes of archetype-defining cell subsets resulting in exclusion, support, or suppression of T cells, respectively. Consistent with this, LymphoMAPs were associated with significantly different clinical outcomes following CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy.},

We evaluated correlates between FCGR2B messenger RNA and/or Fc{$\gamma$}RIIB protein expression and outcomes in 3 de novo DLBCL discovery cohorts treated with R plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) reported by Arthur, Schmitz, and Reddy, and R-CHOP/G-CHOP-treated patients in the GOYA trial (NCT01287741). In the discovery cohorts, higher FCGR2B expression was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS; Arthur: hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.19; P = .0360; Schmitz: HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .0243).

The precise mechanism of premitotic ciliary loss has been controversial, with data supporting either sequential disassembly through the transition zone or, alternatively, a severing event at the base of the cilia. Here we show by live cell imaging and immunofluorescence microscopy that resorbing flagella of Chlamydomonas leave remnants associated with the mother cell wall. We postulated that the remnants are the product of severing of doublet microtubules between the basal bodies and the flagellar transition zone, thereby freeing the centrioles to participate in spindle organization. We show via TEM that flagellar remnants are indeed flagellar transition zones encased in vesicles derived from the flagellar membrane. This transition zone vesicle can be lodged within the cell wall or it can be expelled into the environment. This process is observable in Chlamydomonas, first because the released flagellar remnants can remain associated with the cell by virtue of attachments to the cell wall, and second because the Chlamydomonas transition zone is particularly rich with electron-dense structure. However, release of basal bodies for spindle-associated function is likely to be conserved among the eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Disease-defining signatures in lymphomas, driven by intricate molecular mechanisms, have advanced molecular taxonomies, refined classification, and may guide clinical management; however, the role of these signatures in driving disease hallmarks, including subtype-specific organotropism, remains largely unexplored. Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is an exemplary lymphoma characterized by disease manifestations in the thymic niche, unique genetic alterations, and immune escape. Here, we identified interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)-C99R mutations uniquely occurring in PMBCL through mutational meta-analysis of large-scale data sets. By integrating multiomics approaches with genome editing in PMBCL cells, we revealed that IRF4-C99R contributes to a differentiation block phenotype. Specifically, we showed that IRF4-C99R reduces its binding to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) motif within PRDM1, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of B-cell differentiation, resulting in decreased PRDM1 expression. Additionally, IRF4-C99R suppresses Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase, a key interferon gamma (IFN-{$\gamma$}) pathway regulator, by impairing ISRE motif binding, thereby reducing IFN-{$\gamma$} signaling and increasing thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) expression, which drives TARC-mediated chemotaxis of T regulatory cells. We also revealed that IRF4-C99R upregulates ephrin type-B receptor 1 (EPHB1) through noncanonical activating protein 1-IRF composite motif binding and showed that overexpression of EPHB1 in an immunocompetent syngeneic lymphoma model influenced organotropism to favor thymic localization, without affecting overall tumor burden. IRF4-C99R mutation-induced phenotypes were validated in primary PMBCL tissues using single-nuclei RNA sequencing, confirming that the molecular mechanisms observed in vitro align with the pathophysiology of PMBCL in patients. Together, these findings demonstrate how a single genetic mutation orchestrates the coordinated regulation of hallmark traits including thymus-specific tropism in PMBCL.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients are typically treated with immunochemotherapy containing rituximab (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin-vincristine (Oncovin), and prednisone [R-CHOP]); however, prognosis is extremely poor if R-CHOP fails. To identify genetic mechanisms contributing to primary or acquired R-CHOP resistance, we performed target-panel sequencing of 135 relapsed/refractory DLBCLs (rrDLBCLs), primarily comprising circulating tumor DNA from patients on clinical trials. Comparison with a metacohort of 1670 diagnostic DLBCLs identified 6 genes significantly enriched for mutations upon relapse. TP53 and KMT2D were mutated in the majority of rrDLBCLs, and these mutations remained clonally persistent throughout treatment in paired diagnostic-relapse samples, suggesting a role in primary treatment resistance. Nonsense and missense mutations affecting MS4A1, which encodes CD20, are exceedingly rare in diagnostic samples but show recurrent patterns of clonal expansion following rituximab-based therapy. MS4A1 missense mutations within the transmembrane domains lead to loss of CD20 in vitro, and patient tumors harboring these mutations lacked CD20 protein expression. In a time series from a patient treated with multiple rounds of therapy, tumor heterogeneity and minor MS4A1-harboring subclones contributed to rapid disease recurrence, with MS4A1 mutations as founding events for these subclones. TP53 and KMT2D mutation status, in combination with other prognostic factors, may be used to identify high-risk patients prior to R-CHOP for posttreatment monitoring. Using liquid biopsies, we show the potential to identify tumors with loss of CD20 surface expression stemming from MS4A1 mutations. Implementation of noninvasive assays to detect such features of acquired treatment resistance may allow timely transition to more effective treatment regimens.},

Our analysis reveals evolutionary dynamics of transformation at single-cell resolution, highlighting a shifting TME landscape, with an emerging immune-cell exhaustion signature, co-evolving with the shifting malignant B phenotype in a regulatory ecosystem. Integration of scWGS and scWTS identifies malignant cell pathways upregulated during clonal tumor evolution. Using multi-color immunofluorescence, we transfer these findings to a TME-based transformation biomarker, subsequently validated in two independent pretreatment cohorts. Taken together, our results provide a comprehensive view of the combined genomic and phenotypic evolution of malignant cells during transformation and shifting crosstalk between malignant cells and the TME.},

  abstract = {Notch receptors participate in a signaling pathway in which ligand-induced proteolysis frees the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), allowing it to translocate to the nucleus, form a transcription complex, and induce target gene expression. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (SMZL), and distinct subsets of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are strongly associated with mutations in the 3{$\prime$} end of NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 that disrupt a proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) degron domain and stabilize NICD1 and NICD2. By contrast, mutations leading to constitutive Notch activation are rare in primary B-cell neoplasms, suggesting that Notch activation is confined to ligand-rich tumor microenvironments, or that cryptic strong gain-of-function mutations have been missed in prior analyses. To test these ideas, we used immunohistochemical stains to screen a broad range of B-cell tumors for Notch activation. Our analyses reveal that among small B-cell neoplasms, NICD2 is primarily detected in SMZL and is a common feature of both NOTCH2 wild-type and NOTCH2-mutated SMZLs, similar to prior findings with NOTCH1 in CLL/SLL. The greatest NOTCH2 activation was observed in NOTCH2-mutated SMZLs, particularly within splenic marginal zones. By contrast, little evidence of NOTCH2 activation was observed in DLBCL, even in NOTCH2-mutated tumors, suggesting that selective pressure for NOTCH2 activation is mainly confined to low-grade B-cell neoplasms, whereas DLBCLs with NOTCH1 mutations frequently showed evidence of ongoing NOTCH1 activation. These observations have important implications for the pathogenic role of Notch and its therapeutic targeting in B-cell lymphomas.},

  abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a lethal hematological malignancy with a median survival of 4 years. Its lethality is mainly attributed to a limited understanding of clinical tumor progression and resistance to current therapeutic regimes. Intrinsic, prolonged drug treatment and tumor-microenvironment (TME) facilitated factors impart pro-tumorigenic and drug-insensitivity properties to MCL cells. Hence, elucidating neoteric pharmacotherapeutic molecular targets involved in MCL progression utilizing a global "unified" analysis for improved disease prevention is an earnest need. Using integrated transcriptomic analyses in MCL patients, we identified a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor-1 (FGFR1), and analyses of MCL patient samples showed that high FGFR1 expression was associated with shorter overall survival in MCL patient cohorts. Functional studies using pharmacological intervention and loss of function identify a novel MYC-EZH2-CDKN1C axis-driven proliferation in MCL. Further, pharmacological targeting with erdafitinib, a selective small molecule targeting FGFRs, induced cell-cycle arrest and cell death in-vitro, inhibited tumor progression, and improved overall survival in-vivo. We performed extensive pre-clinical assessments in multiple in-vivo model systems to confirm the therapeutic potential of erdafitinib in MCL and demonstrated FGFR1 as a viable therapeutic target in MCL.},

  abstract = {The genetic subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma have been defined, but the role of epigenetics remains to be comprehensively characterized. We searched genomic DNA from 218 patients across four continents for recurrent DNA methylation patterns and their associations with clinical and molecular features. We identified DNA methylation patterns that were not fully explained by the Epstein-Barr virus status or mutation status, leading to two epitypes described here as HypoBL and HyperBL. Each is characterized by distinct genomic and clinical features including global methylation, mutation burden, aberrant somatic hypermutation, and survival outcomes. Methylation, gene expression, and mutational differences between the epitypes support a model in which each arises from a distinct cell of origin. These results, pending validation in external cohorts, point to a refined risk assessment for patients with Burkitt lymphoma who may experience inferior outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: Burkitt lymphoma can be divided into two epigenetic subtypes (epitypes), each carrying distinct biological, transcriptomic, genomic, and clinical features. Epitype is more strongly associated with clinical and mutational features than the Epstein-Barr virus status or genetic subtype, highlighting an important additional layer of Burkitt lymphoma pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma (BL) accounts for most pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas, being less common but significantly more lethal when diagnosed in adults. Much of the knowledge of the genetics of BL thus far has originated from the study of pediatric BL (pBL), leaving its relationship to adult BL (aBL) and other adult lymphomas not fully explored. We sought to more thoroughly identify the somatic changes that underlie lymphomagenesis in aBL and any molecular features that associate with clinical disparities within and between pBL and aBL. Through comprehensive whole-genome sequencing of 230 BL and 295 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors, we identified additional significantly mutated genes, including more genetic features that associate with tumor Epstein-Barr virus status, and unraveled new distinct subgroupings within BL and DLBCL with 3 predominantly comprising BLs: DGG-BL (DDX3X, GNA13, and GNAI2), IC-BL (ID3 and CCND3), and Q53-BL (quiet TP53). Each BL subgroup is characterized by combinations of common driver and noncoding mutations caused by aberrant somatic hypermutation. The largest subgroups of BL cases, IC-BL and DGG-BL, are further characterized by distinct biological and gene expression differences. IC-BL and DGG-BL and their prototypical genetic features (ID3 and TP53) had significant associations with patient outcomes that were different among aBL and pBL cohorts. These findings highlight shared pathogenesis between aBL and pBL, and establish genetic subtypes within BL that serve to delineate tumors with distinct molecular features, providing a new framework for epidemiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies.},

GCB-type tumors are enriched for EZH2, TNFRSF14, and MEF2B mutations, while MB-type tumors contain increased follicular helper T-cells. MB-type and intratumoral phenotypic diversity are independently associated with increased risk of transformation, supporting biological relevance of these features.
