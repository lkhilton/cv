  abstract = {Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequent lymphoid malignancy, remains incurable in \textasciitilde 40\% of patients. Coding-genome sequencing efforts identified several genes/pathways altered in this disease, as well as genetic subgroups of prognostic and therapeutic significance. However, the large non-coding portion of the genome remained largely unexplored. We recently identified a pervasive hypermutation mechanism targeting active super-enhancers (SEs) in \&gt;90\% of DLBCLs and leading to dysregulation of multiple genes, including well-known lymphoma oncogenes (Bal et al., Nature 2022). This pervasive phenomenon exhibits hallmarks of AID activity, and we provided evidence of its oncogenic relevance by demonstrating that mutational hotspots in the BCL6, BCL2 and CXCR4 SEs impair the binding of specific transcriptional repressors, preventing their negative regulation and creating oncogenic dependencies in DLBCL cells. Here we aimed to define the pathogenic role of non-coding mutations targeting the intragenic SE (iSE) of the BTG2 gene, the second most commonly mutated in DLBCL (39\% of samples analyzed, including 36/93 primary cases and 7/29 cell lines).BTG2 encodes a member of the B-cell translocation gene (BTG)/ Transducer of ErbB2.1(TOB) family involved in transcriptional co-activation and modulation of mRNA abundance. BTG2 is also targeted by somatic missense mutations in 6-11\% of DLBCL samples, suggesting a major role in the pathogenesis of this disease, which has not been explored.In order to identify functionally relevant BTG2 SE mutations, we first screened an extended panel of 286 DLBCL samples for the presence of mutational clusters targeting predicted transcription factor binding motifs. We identified a 20bp sequence stretch that was significantly hypermutated in these tumors, as compared to other lymphoma types or to non-lymphoid tumors (n=64/286, 22\%; vs 0/17 Burkitt Lymphomas; 18/284 Follicular Lymphomas; 1/240 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemias, and 0/1596 other tumors; p\&lt;0.0001, Fisher's exact test). In particular, mutations of the C at position +904 to G or T were exclusively detected in 11\% DLBCL samples (32/286, p\&lt;0.0001, Fisher's exact test).To define the consequences of BTG2 C904 mutations, we then investigated the impact of reverting the mutation to the wild type nucleotide in 2 mutant DLBCL cell lines, using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Correction of the mutation led to a significant counter selection of the corrected clones (\textasciitilde 85\% reduction in a clone recovery assay, compared to control; p\&lt;0.001, Fisher's exact test) and to reduced BTG2 mRNA expression (p\&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA), suggesting oncogenic addiction.In silico motif prediction and in vitro DNA-binding assays using mutant vs wild type oligonucleotides in two different DLBCL cell lines, followed by mass spectrometry, identified the Transcription Factor AP4 (TFAP4) as a protein specifically bound to the wild type, but not to the mutant sequences. TFAP4 is an important regulator of B-cell proliferation and cell fate decisions, which can function as a transcriptional activator or repressor in germinal center B-cells and acts downstream of/in parallel with c-MYC. We confirmed that the C904G and C904T SE mutation impaired TFAP4 binding in isogenic DLBCL cell lines by ChIP-qPCR and led to increased BTG2 expression (p\&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA). Moreover, loss of TFAP4 in CRISPR-Cas9 edited DLBCL cells led to higher BTG2 expression levels, documenting TFAP4 as a direct negative regulator of BTG2 expression (p\&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA). Consistently, single cell analysis of normal GC B cells revealed an inverse correlation between the expression pattern of TFAP4 and BTG2 in cells primed to undergo plasma cell differentiation vs cells committed to dark zone re-entry, suggesting that these two genes may function as a molecular switch in the cell fate decision of GC B cells. The programs modulated by BTG2 and TFAP4 in the GC, and disrupted in tumors carrying deregulated BTG2 alleles, will be presented, as defined by RNA-seq analysis of 3 isogenic GC-derived cell lines followed by interrogation of over 100 clinically annotated primary DLBCL biopsies.Together, these data identify TFAP4 as a novel regulator of BTG2 and reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism by which mutations in the BTG2 SE disrupt this circuit and contribute to lymphomagenesis through deregulating BTG2 expression.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent disease that undergoes histological transformation (HT) to aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 8-15\% of patients. FLs frequently share genetic features with DLBCL, especially those of the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) cell-of-origin (COO) and the EZB/C3 genetic subgroup, and approximately 80\% of transformed FL (tFL) are classified as GCB. Our current understanding of the genetics of FL and tFL is based on a variety of studies, most of which have sequenced tumors in small case numbers or using targeted approaches such that the potential role of non-coding mutations and aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM) in predicting HT have not previously been fully explored. Methods: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 212 FL (including 24 from patients that subsequently underwent HT) and 241 de novo DLBCL were analyzed. Simple somatic mutations (SSMs) were called using an ensemble of somatic variant callers, while structural variants (SVs) were called with Manta and copy number variants (CNVs) with Battenberg and GISTIC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with break-apart probes (BA-FISH) was used to identify MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 translocations, and with IGH /BCL2 dual-fusion probes (DF-FISH) for a subset of FLs. To compare the genetics of FL and DLBCL, 83 significantly mutated genes (SMGs) were identified with dNdS, MutSigCV, HotMaps, and OncoDriveFML, and non-silent mutations were tabulated for their presence in each genome. For 38 hypermutated regions, we used a region-specific threshold to binarize the data to aSHM/no aSHM. Recurrent missense mutations in FOXO1, MYD88L265P, CREBBP lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain, EZH2Y646, MEF2B, and STAT6 were tabulated separately from other mutations in these genes. Using only the FL tumors from patients with no evidence of subsequent transformation and all available de novo DLBCLs, we trained a random forest classifier to separate these two entities using this set of 129 features, including MYC and BCL6 translocations. To validate this classifier, we fit a linear model to the number of FL votes from each discovery case, utilizing the 65 features (including 19 aSHM features) that were adequately sequenced in a validation cohort of 127 tFL. Statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons where necessary. Results: This large cohort of FL and DLBCL genomes has enabled the curation of an extensive list of novel and established FL driver genes and the identification of distinguishing genetic features among SMGs and CNVs. Loci that are significantly enriched for mutations in FL vs. DLBCL include the CREBBP KAT domain (OR 11.5, P {$<$} 0.0001), RRAGC (OR 9.61, P {$<$} 0.001), and ATP6V1B2 (OR 11.17, P {$<$} 0.001). Deletions of ARID1A (OR 4.74, P {$<$} 0.1), PTEN (OR 3.65, P {$<$} 0.01), and TNFRSF14 (OR 3.31, P {$<$} 0.01) were among the CNVs significantly enriched in FL. Out of 156 FLs, 24 (15\%) were negative for BCL2 translocations by BA-FISH, but 4 (17\%) of these had BCL2 translocations detected from WGS data. All 4 of these cryptic events were confirmed using IGH /BCL2 DF-FISH. Using a threshold of 0.7, the linear model separated discovery FL cases into a more DLBCL-like subgroup, termed dFL (n = 107), and a genetically homogeneous subgroup enriched for the FL-associated features, which we describe as constrained FL (cFL, n = 105). This separation is supported by more mutations in dFL vs cFL across several aSHM loci, including the transcription start sites for BCL6, BCL7A, DTX1, and ZFP36L1 (Figure 1), consistent with reduced exposure to the germinal center reaction in cFL. Within the targeted capture validation cohort of tFL, 30 (24\%) tumors were classified as cFL and 97 (76\%) as dFL. The tFL cohort was significantly depleted for mutations in the CREBBP KAT domain (OR 0.59, P {$<$} 0.05), and were significantly less frequently classified as cFL (OR 0.30, P {$<$} 0.0001) compared to the discovery FLs. Conclusions: The distinction between cFL and dFL is strongly driven by CREBBP KAT domain mutations and different rates of aSHM genome wide. Given the known early clonal nature of CREBBP mutations in FL and its role in regulating germinal center cycling, we speculate that CREBBP KAT mutations may limit the exposure of FL to the dark zone, reducing the opportunity for aSHM and creating an evolutionary constraint that may limit the opportunity for HT. This classification may serve as a useful biomarker to identify FLs at higher risk of HT. Figure 1 Disclosures Coyle:\hphantom{,}Allakos, Inc.: Consultancy.

  abstract = {Background: The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), obinutuzumab (G), has shown improved outcomes versus rituximab (R) in indolent lymphomas; however, no improvement was seen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and the molecular basis is unclear. The inhibitory Fc gamma receptor IIB (Fc {$\gamma$}RIIB), expressed on lymphoma cells, can impair the effects of direct targeting mAbs, such as R, by binding and internalizing them, reducing opsonization and limiting Fc{$\gamma$}R-mediated killing. We hypothesized that Fc{$\gamma$}RIIB expression on cellular effectors and/or the lymphoma confers treatment resistance in some patients (pts) and evaluated if outcomes differ for therapies involving a non-internalized mAb (G).Methods: We evaluated correlates between FCGR2B mRNA and/or Fc{$\gamma$}RIIB protein expression and pt outcomes in two discovery cohorts of de novo DLBCL treated with R-CHOP (Arthur et al. 2018, n=372; Schmitz et al. 2018, n=234), and the phase III GOYA trial (NCT01287741; n=552), which compared R-CHOP with G-CHOP in pts with previously untreated DLBCL. FCGR2B mRNA expression was assessed by RNA-Seq, and protein expression was assessed in evaluable cohorts by immunohistochemistry, using tissue microarrays with macrophages identified by CD68. FCGR2B expression was also measured by a NanoString assay (Arthur cohort). Cox regression analyzed the impact of Fc{$\gamma$}RIIB/FCGR2B expression on progression-free survival (PFS), with univariate and multivariate models adjusted for International Prognostic Index (IPI), cell of origin (COO), and BCL2 protein expression.Results: In the discovery cohorts, a higher FCGR2B expression was significantly associated with shorter PFS (Arthur: HR 1.09 [95\% CI: 1.01--1.19], P=0.036; Schmitz: HR 1.13 [95\% CI: 1.02--1.26], P=0.0243). Expression by NanoString strongly correlated with RNA-Seq, confirming the association with shorter PFS (HR 1.13 [95\% CI: 1.04--1.23], P=0.0048). In GOYA, a significant association between PFS and FCGR2B was observed in the R arm (HR 1.26 [95\% CI: 1.00--1.58], P=0.0455), with no prognostic effect observed for G (HR 0.91 [95\% CI: 0.69--1.20], P=0.5). Pts with high FCGR2B expression appeared to benefit more from G than R (HR 0.67 [95\% CI: 0.44--1.02], P=0.0622), in contrast to pts with low FCGR2B expression (HR 1.58 [95\% CI: 1.00--2.50], P=0.0503). In both Arthur and GOYA cohorts, FCGR2B expression by RNA-Seq was associated with Fc{$\gamma$}RIIB on the tumor, which correlated with a shorter PFS for R (HR 2.17 [95\% CI: 1.04--4.50], P=0.03), but not G (HR 1.37 [95\% CI: 0.66--2.87], P=0.4). This prognostic effect on PFS was independent of established prognostic biomarkers, IPI, COO and BCL2.Conclusion: High Fc{$\gamma$}RIIB/FCGR2B expression in pts with DLBCL has prognostic value in those treated with R and may confer differential responsiveness to R or G.Citation Format: Laura K.

  abstract = {Multiple immune therapies such as CD19 CAR T-cells and bispecific antibodies are now approved for patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). The efficacy of these therapies is likely influenced by lymphoma microenvironment (LME) characteristics, but these have not been comprehensively characterized in rrLBCL. We performed single-nucleus multiome (RNA + ATAC), bulk RNA sequencing, and whole exome sequencing (WES) of 120 biopsies from 115 patients with rrLBCL to capture both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell (NHC) types. After stringent quality control, 970,239 cells were analyzed. Non-B-cell lineages were classified into 76 transcriptionally-distinct cell types using unsupervised clustering (21 T/NK subsets; 25 myeloid subsets; 30 NHC subsets), including many subpopulations that have not been previously characterized in lymphoma.LME archetypes were defined by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of non-B cell types, yielding 5 cellular modules: lymph-node 1 [LN1] and lymph-node 2 [LN2] characterized by lymph-node structural cell types, antigen presenting cells, and na\"ive and memory T cells; T-effector/exhausted [TEX] characterized by high frequencies of effector and exhausted CD8 T-cells; and fibroblast/macrophage 1 [FMAC1] and 2 [FMAC2] characterized by high frequencies of macrophage and fibroblast subsets including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The LN1 and LN2 modules and the FMAC1 and FMAC2 modules were each correlated and therefore considered collectively in tumor archetype construction, resulting in three major archetypes: LN (33\% of tumors), TEX (25\% of tumors) and FMAC (42\% of tumors). The TEX archetype was significantly enriched for the activated B-cell (ABC) cell of origin subtype (P = 0.01) and germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype occurred more frequently within the FMAC archetype (P = 0.08). The FMAC archetype was significantly enriched for ``Dark-zone'' signature (DZsig)-positive (P \&lt; 0.001), and the LN archetype significantly enriched for DZsig-negative (P=0.002) tumors. There was no significant association between archetype and LymphGen subtype. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed significant differences in predicted ligand-receptor pair interactions between archetypes, with the FMAC archetype being characterized by TGFB1 and PDGF signaling; the TEX archetype by PD1, CTLA4 and TIM3 signaling; and the LN archetype by CXCL12, IL7, CCL19 and CCL21 signaling.Among these biopsies, 17 were pre- and 13 post-CAR T cell therapy. Analysis of these cases generated the hypothesis that the LN archetype was associated with greater benefit from CAR T cell therapy. To test this, we leveraged our bulk RNA-sequencing data plus published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in second line rrLBCL to develop a Na\"ive Bayes classifier for these archetypes. Evaluation of response data from ZUMA7 showed that the greatest benefit for axi-cel compared to chemotherapy was observed within the LN subtype (HR=0.2; P\&lt;0.0001), compared to the FMAC (HR=0.34; P\&lt;0.0001) and TEX (HR=0.65; P=0.12). As such, LN subtype patients had significantly longer PFS compared to FMAC and TEX subtype patients in the axi-cel arm (HR=0.5, P=0.01), with 1 year PFS of 70\%, 46\% and 37\%, respectively. There was no significant difference in PFS between archetypes in the chemotherapy arm (HR=1.1; P=0.74).In conclusion, accurate construction of the rrLBCL LME using direct cell measurements of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells with single-nucleus genomics permits the identification of cell types, cell modules, pathways of cell-cell interaction, and LME archetypes with important implications for LBCL biology, and may present an opportunity for LME-guided selection of patients most likely to benefit from cellular therapy.},

  abstract = {Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, incurable mature B-cell lymphoma that can have either an aggressive or indolent clinical course. The hallmark aberration of MCL is the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation that places CCND1 under control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus resulting in its constitutive expression. CCND1/IGH translocation occurs in nearly all MCL cases and arises during VDJ recombination. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of MCLs has shown the prevalence of additional structural variations (SV), particularly in tumors with poor outcome. Complex rearrangements, such as chromothripsis and chromoplexy have been observed in MCL but their role in lymphomagenesis has not been determined. We hypothesized that some of these complex rearrangements afford a selective advantage to the tumor by disrupting tumor suppressor genes or by placing oncogenes in proximity to regulatory elements in cis, thereby resulting in ectopic expression.We performed WGS on tumor DNA extracted from 106 RCHOP-treated MCL patients. Matching ribosomal-depleted RNA-seq data was available for all tumor samples. Gene expression count values were obtained using Salmon and counts were normalized using the DESeq2 method. Structural variants were identified using a consensus between GRIDSS and Manta and these were analyzed to identify the topology of complex rearrangements using JaBbA. This allows the annotation of rearrangements such as chromothripsis and chromoplexy and enables the detection of genes near new regulatory elements through complex (multi-breakpoint) rearrangements. We supplemented this analysis by including 57 published classical and non-nodal leukemic MCL genomes.Chromothripsis and chromoplexy were observed in 8 and 12 tumors, respectively. The majority of the genomes were associated with isolated structural variations such as large deletions, inversions and reciprocal translocations were more common. Six genes (BCL10, TRAF6, TRAF3, MAP3K7, BTK, RELB) coding for canonical and non-canonical NF{$\kappa$}B signaling proteins were found rearranged to within 1Mbp of a na\"ive B-cell super-enhancer region. The TRAF6 rearrangement was part of a chromothripsis and chromoplexy event involving both chr9 and chr11. A separate chromothripsis example involving chr1 placed each of BCL10 and NOTCH2 within 100-200kbp of super-enhancers. A 1Mbp region containing RELB was amplified and inserted into chr19p approximately 150kbp downstream a super-enhancer. An 800kbp deletion brought MAP3K7 to within 400kbp of a super-enhancer. DAZAP1, a gene known to be recurrently mutated in MCL, was translocated upstream to within 300kbp of a super-enhancer by t(5;19)(p13.3;p15.33). TRAF3 was translocated 400kbp upstream a super-enhancer by t(14;20)(q32.32;q13.13). None of the aforementioned SVs were associated with a detectable increase in expression of the affected gene. In contrast, we identified one genome in which the MYC oncogene was relocated 500kbp upstream of a super-enhancer via an unbalanced t(4;8)(q21.23;q24.21) translocation. In this case, MYC expression was in the 95 th percentile of MYC expression across the cohort. Focal deletions and amplifications were also found affecting lymphoma driver genes. Focal amplifications affecting 3q (34 tumors) and 5p (9 tumors), were among the most common recurrent events. These respectively affect the TERC and TERT genes, both involved in telomerase function. All tumors with TERT amplifications also showed TERC amplifications. TERC and TERT were expressed higher on average in amplified tumors than in unamplified tumors. Two tumors showed focal deletions affecting the 3' end of BIRC3. The focal deletion in one tumor was found to span to the 3' end of BIRC2 resulting in a BIRC2/BIRC3 fusion. Aberrant splicing across the two genes was evident in matching tumor RNA-seq data.Complex rearrangements in MCL have been found to link distant super-enhancer elements with a variety of lymphoma oncogenes. We noted a recurrence of such events affecting known regulators of NF{$\kappa$}B signaling. We are using nanopore-based long-read PromethION sequencing to validate the structure of the derivative chromosome in these cases. Although these genes were not detectably overexpressed, deregulation of genes may be occurring by other means. The full extent of deregulation of NF{$\kappa$}B and other oncogenic pathways will be revealed as complex rearrangements are studied in additional MCL tumors.Coyle:\hphantom{,}Allakos, Inc.: Consultancy.

  abstract = {Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a rare B-cell malignancy mainly affecting the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. Clinical outcomes are variable, with potential transformation into aggressive large B-cell tumors with poor survival rates. Despite advances in targeted therapies, specific biomarkers are urgently needed to guide treatment as incidence continues to rise. This study aims to extend our knowledge of SMZL biology by integrating genetic, phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data to establish more precise molecular classifications aimed at guiding personalized treatments.We defined epigenetically distinct subtypes of SMZL using DNA methylation array data of 142 patients divided into a discovery (n=86, 60\%) and a validation cohort (n=56, 40\%). K-means clustering of the top 2000 most variable CpG sites consistently identified two similar clusters in both cohorts. Bootstrapped univariate survival analyses revealed significant differences in time to first treatment (TTFT) between these clusters in both the discovery (p=.007) and validation cohorts (p=.024). Subsequent clustering on the entire cohort allowed us to classify the subgroups as SMZL-HR (high risk, n=58, 41\%) and SMZL-LR (low risk, n=84, 59\%), reflecting the observed differences in TTFT.Twelve clinico-biological features were significantly enriched in SMZL-HR cases, including female sex (p\&lt;.001) , IGHV1-2*04 usage (p\&lt;.001), gene mutations (KLF2 (p\&lt;.001), KMT2D (p=.0015), TRAF3 (p\&lt;.001), NOTCH2 (p=.015), BCL10 (p=.007)) and chromosomal alterations (del(7q), gain(3q), gain(12q) (all p\&lt;0.01)). SMZL-HR patients also had higher rates of therapeutic intervention (p\&lt;0.001), disease transformation (p=0.01), and mortality (p\&lt;0.001) compared to SMZL-LR patients. Tumour mutational burden (TMB) (p\&lt;0.001) and the fraction of the SBS40 (p\&lt;0.001) mutational signatures were also increased in SMZL-HR compared to SMZL-LR. In contrast, SMZL-LR was associated with MYD88 mutations (p=.02), Trisomy 12 and 3 (p\&lt;.001 and p=.02).We found that the DNA methylation-based proliferative history score epiCMIT was significantly higher in SMZL-HR than SMZL-LR patients (p\&lt;0.001). TMB was positively correlated with epiCMIT (r=0.35, p\&lt;.001), reinforcing the link between extensive tumor proliferative histories and the acquisition of somatic mutations. Telomere length (TL) data (median 3.1, range: 2.38-7.57 kb) showed a significant negative correlation with epiCMIT (R=-0.3, p=.001). Transcriptomic comparisons of SMZL-HR and SMZL-LR revealed 399 differentially expressed genes (232 under-expressed, 167 overexpressed; FDR\&lt;.05, log fold change \&gt;1.5). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted pathways linked to elevated cell division, specifically E2F targets (NES=1.98, p\&lt;.01) and the G2M checkpoint (NES=2.07, p\&lt;.01), and KAMMINGA\_EZH2 targets (NES=1.91, p=.006). Taken together, these results suggest that SMZL-HR clones have a history of and higher potential for cellular division, potentiated by EZH2 targets associated with chromatin modification/stabilization, providing enhanced cellular resilience against replicative stress.Univariate Cox regression analysis tested the impact 60 clinico-biological features on TTFT and overall survival (OS). SMZL-HR status (HR: 2.0, p=.0013) and epiCMIT \&gt;median (HR: 1.67, p=.014) were significantly linked to shorter TTFT (5 vs. 16 months). Additionally, 46\% of patients were classified into a poor-risk ``NNK-like'' group and 20\% into the ``High-M'' group, as defined by Bonfiglio and Arribas, respectively. Both groups were associated with shorter TTFT (HR: 1.57 and 1.9, p=0.002 and 0.008, respectively). Significant predictors of shorter OS included the SMZL-HR epitype (HR: 2.5, p=.025). SMZL-HR patients had significantly shorter TTFT regardless of their Bonfiglio/Arribas classification. Multivariate Cox analysis (including 130 patients with 91 events) with 4 covariates (SMZL-HR, epiCMIT, NNK-like, High-M), revealed that SMZL-HR was the only independent variable in the final model (HR: 2.63, p=.001).Overall, this study presents a comprehensive framework that integrates (epi)genomic data with survival analysis, identifying two distinct disease entities, each with a discrete biological and clinical landscapes. This enhanced understanding supports the potential for improved personalized treatment strategies as well as better prognostic assessment for patients with SMZL.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are the most common lymphoid malignancies in adults. Despite advances in molecular classification, the pathogenesis of DLBCL, particularly of the BN2 subtype, remains poorly understood, which limits the advancement of tailored and more effective therapeutic strategies. BN2-DLBCL are characterized by alterations in BCL6 and NOTCH2, lack an AICDA mutational signature, and are presumed to arise outside germinal centers (GC). Among its defining alterations, truncating mutations in SPEN (SPENTRUNC) are significantly enriched, but the effects and clinical relevance of these alterations remain unexplored. Here, we found that SPENTRUNC likely represent loss-of-function (LOF) events, as they led to reduced SPEN protein levels (p=0.04). Clinically, SPENTRUNC mutations correlated with significantly worse overall survival (OS), especially in non-GCB DLBCL patients (HR: 1.82; p\&lt;0.0001). Co-occurring truncating mutations in NOTCH2 (NOTCH2TRUNC), which confer gain-of-function (GOF) effects, further worsened prognosis when in combination with SPENTRUNC (HR: 3.33; p\&lt;0.0001). Patients with dual SPENTRUNC/NOTCH2TRUNC (SN2) mutations were also older (p=0.03) and had poorer ECOG performance status (p=0.02), defining a high-risk subgroup urgently needing targeted therapies.To understand how SN2 mutations shape disease biology, we introduced B cell--specific SpenLOF and Notch2GOF mutations in mice. The SN2 genotype led to a cumulative expansion of autoimmune/aged B cells (AiBCs), a hyper-reactive inflammatory B cell subset implicated in autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis. Given the hypothesized extra-follicular origin of BN2-DLBCL, we tested whether AiBCs could arise in SN2 mice lacking Bcl6, which is essential for GC formation. Indeed, AiBC expansion occurred independently of GC formation, as SN2;Bcl6--/-- and SN2 mice showed comparable AiBC levels, supporting their extra-follicular derivation.To further evaluate their malignant potential, we assessed clonality and proliferation in SN2 AiBCs versus their wild-type (WT) counterparts. SN2 AiBCs exhibited significantly higher clonality and proliferation (p\&lt;0.05). Notably, female SN2 AiBCs showed even greater proliferation (KI67+) than male SN2 AiBCs (p\&lt;0.0001), a difference not observed in WT mice. This disproportionate fitness of female SN2 cells translated to a competitive advantage, as shown by bone marrow chimera assays (p=0.04), regardless of the hormonal sex status of the recipient animal. Accordingly, female SN2 mice had significantly reduced survival due to lymphoma development than their male counterparts (OS HR: 13.4; p=0.001), a trend mirrored in human SN2-DLBCL patients (OS HR: 4.14; p=0.07). This sex-bias is of particular interest, as SPEN is known to be essential in X-chromosomal inactivation (XCI), a process happening in females to equilibrate X chromosomal gene dosage to male cells. Although XIST RNA-FISH did not reveal changes in XCI (p=0.2), SN2 lymphomas showed significant hypomethylation of the X chromosome compared to WT B cells and N2 lymphomas (p=5.9e-4). Autosomal regions, in contrast, were hypermethylated (p\&lt;2.2e-18), suggesting X-chromosome--specific dysregulation due to SPEN loss. Among X-linked genes, TLR7, a known AiBC driver, emerged as a candidate mediator. Indeed, female SN2 lymphomas expressed higher TLR7 levels than males (p=0.05). To test whether the TLR7 pathway confers an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability, we treated SN2 lymphoma cells with AZ1495, an IRAK1/4 inhibitor acting downstream of TLR7, and found that only female cells showed in vitro and in vivo sensitivity (p\&lt;0.05). Efficacy was further confirmed using a female human SN2-DLBCL PDX model (p=0.01), supporting the translational potential of targeting this axis.In summary, SPENTRUNC defines a poor-prognosis marker in DLBCL, and cooperates with NOTCH2TRUNC to drive aggressive, extra-follicular lymphomas via expansion of pathogenic AiBCs. We identify a novel, sex-biased pathogenic mechanism involving X-chromosomal dysregulation and TLR7 overexpression, offering a rationale for precision therapy in BN2-DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) is currently classified into subtypes based on morphology and pathological features. However, there is accumulating evidence that subtypes of CHL can also be distinguished by their genomic profiles. To delineate molecular subtypes of CHL, we applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) consensus clustering and discovered four robust subsets of tumors (clusters) using recurrent genomic events (Aoki, et al. ASH 2023). In particular, we found frequent CSF2RB mutations in cluster 1, which is characterized by mutations in TNFAIP3, CSF2RB and GNA13. CSF2RB is the common signaling subunit of the cytokine receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, with cytokine-independent activating mutations previously reported in the transmembrane and extracellular domains in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and breast cancer, respectively. However, the functional role of CSF2RB mutations in CHL pathogenesis remains unknown.Materials and methods: We performed targeted and whole exome sequencing of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells (n=116) purified using laser capture microdissection and flow cytometry (FCM)-based cell sorting. For in vitro functional studies, we retrovirally expressed CSF2RB WT or mutants observed in CHL tumors into two CHL-derived cell lines (L428, U-HO1). Using these isogenic models, we characterized the full spectrum of domain-specific mutations and elucidated the role of CSF2RB alterations in oncogenic signaling. Moreover, to investigate spatial tumor microenvironment architecture, we performed imaging mass cytometry (IMC) on the exome/targeted sequencing cohort using a customized antibody panel.Results: In 26/107 cases (24.3\%), we identified recurrent CSF2RB mutations, which clustered in the cytoplasmic domain (exon 14). Mutations were categorized as missense (n=2), multiple-hit (n=3), and truncating (n=21) mutations. Functional characterization in the L428 model showed that STAT5 was hyperphosphorylated in cells expressing all truncating mutants observed in cases with CHL (p.S723*, p.E788*, p.Lys838*, p.Q853*, p.Q867*, and p.Gln885*) compared to WT cells in an IL-5-dependent manner. Focusing on the functional consequences of the most commonly observed hotspot, the CSF2RB-p.E788* frameshift mutation, we generated cells with a CSF2RB heterozygous genotype by 1:1 transfection of WT and mutant alleles (WT/p.E788*) in U-HO1. With IL-3 or IL-5 (but not GM-CSF) stimulation, we validated that pSTAT5 was markedly higher in WT/p.E788* compared to WT cells. Differential gene expression analysis by RNA-seq revealed up-regulation of common IL-2 signaling pathway molecules and cytokine gene expression signatures, including genes such as IL-13 and CCL17 (TARC) in p.E788* cells compared to WT cells in the L428 model. These findings were validated in the U-HO1 model with IL-3 or IL-5 stimulation. In accord with the gene expression results, we detected higher amounts of IL-13 and TARC by ELISA in the supernatant from cells expressing all truncating mutants compared with WT cells in the L428 model. Furthermore, these gain-of-function phenotypes could be reversed by a selective JAK2 inhibitor (pacritinib), suggesting deregulated cytokine-dependent JAK2-STAT5 signaling leads to increases in IL-13 and CCL17 protein expression. Next, we performed an in-vitro transwell T-cell migration assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors and found that supernatant from p.E788* cells significantly enhanced migration of CCR4+ T cells, which contains FOXP3+ Tregs, compared with supernatant from WT cells. Enhanced migration was completely blocked by an anti-CCR4 antagonist. Finally, spatial analysis using IMC data confirmed the close proximity between CCL17+ HRS cells and CCR4+ T cells in primary CHL samples. In particular, we observed a significant enrichment of FOXP3+ Tregs in close proximity to HRS cells in the CSF2RB-mutation enriched molecular cluster.Conclusion:CSF2RB mutations contribute to deregulated, cytokine-dependent, oncogenic signaling, leading to downstream IL-13 related cell-autonomous phenotypes and TARC related tumor microenvironment composition and functions. We predict these phenotypes will pinpoint therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities, and may provide precision therapeutic approaches based on genetic subtype definitions in CHL.},

  abstract = {IntroductionFollicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is considered incurable when presenting in advanced stage. When treatment is required, immunochemotherapy is typically associated with excellent disease control. However, most patients eventually experience disease relapse and \textasciitilde 10-20\% experience histological transformation (HT), typically to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Progression of disease within 24 months (POD24) and HT are the 2 major events that dictate dismal patient outcomes. Available risk models are not able to reproducibly identify, at the time of diagnosis, these high-risk patients following different treatment regimens. We performed an analysis using genomic data to identify biologically and clinically unified subgroups within a real-world cohort of FL patients with advanced stage disease uniformly treated with bendamustine-rituximab (BR)- a modern standard-of-care regimen.MethodsThe patient cohort was identified in the British Columbia Cancer Lymphoid Cancer database with the following criteria: age 18 years or older, FL grades 1-3A, symptomatic advanced stage disease (Ann Arbor stages III-IV or not amenable to radiation) and received BR as first systemic therapy. DNA (n = 193 [whole genome (n = 51) and exome (n = 142)]) sequencing was performed on diagnostic biopsies alongside fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for BCL2 rearrangement. Manta and GRIDSS2 were used to identify structural variants. Somatic point mutations were obtained using an ensemble of 4 variant callers. Selected coding variants, hotspots, mutations in aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM) targets, and BCL2 rearrangement status were converted to a binary matrix for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. Battenberg was used to identify copy number alterations from WGS data. Sigprofiler was run on samples with WGS data to identify mutation signatures. Using the clustering results, a random forest (RF) classifier was trained to assign samples to genetic classes.ResultsHistone modifying genes were the most frequently mutated genes with KMT2D, CREBBP, and EZH2 mutated in 68\%, 61\%, and 22\% of tumors, respectively. Rearrangements in BCL2 were detected in 90\% of tumors using FISH and/or sequencing methods. Application of NMF clustering resolved an optimal solution with 4 genetic clusters. The first group was characterized by an increased burden of mutations at regions commonly affected by aSHM (aSHM cluster; 33\% of the cohort). The second group was characterized by samples with missense mutations in the CREBBP lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain (C-KAT cluster; 23\% of the cohort). The third group was enriched for EZH2 Y646 hotspot mutations and TNFRSF14 mutations (EZT cluster; 31\% of the cohort). The final group had a paucity of recurrent driver mutations, including KMT2D (KWT cluster; 14\% of the cohort). Although the NMF clustering did not include copy number, we identified copy number alterations associated with certain subgroups. Amplifications of the 1q region containing FCGR2B were enriched in the aSHM cluster. Amplifications in chromosome 7 containing genes associated with lymphoma, such as EZH2, were present in all clusters except the C-KAT cluster. Deletions of the 1p region containing TNFRSF14 were enriched among EZT tumors. Mutation signature analysis revealed higher levels of SBS84, a signature associated with AID activity, in the aSHM cluster.The m7-FLIPI risk score failed to predict POD24 in our cohort (16.5\% vs. 20\% POD24 rate in patients with low vs. high risk; P = 0.60). There was a significant difference in the POD24 proportions between the genetic subgroups (P \&lt; 0.001) with only one event in the EZT cluster (2\%) compared with 29\%, 24\% and 8\% in the aSHM, C-KAT and KWT clusters, respectively. Moreover, the EZT cluster had a lower cumulative rate of HT (5-year rate 2\% compared with 18\% aSHM, 16\% C-KAT, and 16\% KWT; log-rank P = 0.02 across the groups).ConclusionsWe identified 4 novel genetic subgroups of advanced stage FL with prognostic implications. In the context of front-line BR, patients in the EZT subgroup had excellent outcomes, including a very low rate of HT. Development of an RF classifier allows application to other patient cohorts to validate these clusters beyond symptomatic advanced stage disease and determine whether the clusters are predictive, identifying selective advantage to specific treatment regimens.},

  abstract = {A significant proportion of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with immunochemotherapy containing rituximab (R-CHOP) exhibit either primary or acquired treatment resistance. The advancement of therapeutics in the relapse setting has likely been encumbered by our limited understanding of the molecular features that underlie resistance to R-CHOP. Unfortunately, our knowledge of DLBCL genetics is mostly limited to analyses conducted on diagnostic tissue biopsies, which have not been exposed to the selective pressures imposed by therapy. Identifying genetic alterations that contribute to treatment resistance may reveal additional treatment options and lead to biomarkers allowing patients to be paired with appropriate treatments. Genetic subgroups are gaining popularity as a new strategy to implement precision medicine in DLBCL (1). The relevance of these and other biomarkers in the relapse setting remains unclear due to limited genetic exploration of relapsed and refractory DLBCL (rrDLBCL). Progress has been limited, in part, by the requirement of tissue biopsies collected after relapse. It is well established that quantitative genomic techniques such as digital PCR and targeted sequencing can be used to determine the proportion of tumor DNA in plasma from lymphoma patients (2). With a sufficiently broad panel, sequencing affords additional opportunities including the ability to identify subclonal structure and population dynamics over time. This presentation will discuss our recent analysis of a large collection of ctDNA primarily comprising DLBCL patients on various clinical trials (3). Targeted sequencing of these samples and comparison to exome data from a meta-cohort of previously characterized untreated DLBCL biopsies revealed six genes significantly enriched for mutations upon relapse. We found both TP53 and KMT2D were mutated in the majority of rrDLBCLs, and these mutations persisted in the dominant clone following relapse, suggesting a role in primary treatment resistance. By inferring subclonal dynamics, we observed recurrent patterns of clonal expansion and contraction following rituximab-based therapy, with MS4A1 mutations representing the only example of consistent clonal expansion. MS4A1 missense mutations within the transmembrane domains led to loss of CD20 expression in vitro, and patient tumors harboring these mutations lacked CD20 protein expression. Our analysis nominates TP53 and KMT2D mutation status as novel prognostic factors that may facilitate the identification of high-risk patients prior to therapy. Moreover, we have demonstrated the potential to identify tumors with loss of CD20 surface expression stemming from MS4A1 mutations. Implementation of noninvasive assays to detect such features of acquired treatment resistance may allow timely transition to more effective treatment regimens. In certain scenarios whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be successfully applied to ctDNA, thereby allowing the identification of mutations, structural variation, and copy number changes. Low-pass sequencing of shotgun libraries can also be used to ascertain course estimates of ctDNA levels as well as the copy number landscape (4). Given the importance of copy number and structural alterations in the inference of genetic subgroups, these methods may allow the exploration of these groups and their stability over time.

  abstract = {Introduction: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) accounts for approximately 50\% of all pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas compared to 1-2\% in adults. Adult BL (aBL) remains a poorly understood entity and its relationship to pediatric BL (pBL) and to DLBCL has not been fully elucidated. The variable treatment outcomes between these entities necessitate a more thorough understanding of the genetic and molecular features underlying their biology to enable better prognostication and more effective treatments. We sought to comprehensively determine genetic features shared with DLBCL and those that are unique to BL, to further delineate genetic subgroupings within each entity.Methods: Samples for this study were collected through the Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP). We sequenced the tumor genomes of 139 pBL and 92 aBL, consisting of both EBV-positive (EBV+) and EBV-negative (EBV-) BLs, and compared these to the genomes of 252 DLBCL patients. All cases were analyzed for simple somatic mutations (SSM), recurrent copy number variations (CNV), structural variations (SV), aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM), and SSM hotspots. Mutations were used as features for the identification of genetic subgroups using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering.Results: Clustering of BL and DLBCL revealed six distinct genetic subgroups (Figure 1) with three primarily representing DLBCLs (DLBCL-1, DLBCL-2, and DLBCL-3) and three predominantly comprising BLs (M53-BL, IC-BL, and DGG-BL). The DLBCL-predominant subgroups partially overlapped with those previously described and resembled features of EZB and ST2-like subgroups. The frequency of aBLs within these subgroups was higher than that of pBL patients (p=0.0005). The new cluster M53-BL consists of both pBL (9/27) and aBL (13/27) samples and is characterized by the highest prevalence of mutations in TP53 accompanied by the paucity of other driver mutations but without the aneuploidy associated with the A53 subgroup described in DLBCL. Enrichment of EBV- samples in this cluster further corroborate our previous findings of TP53 mutations being associated with EBV- BL. IC-BL is characterized by mutations in ID3, CCND3, and SMARCA4. In contrast, DGG-BL, where 65\% of the cluster consisted of EBV+ BL samples, had mutations in DDX3X, GNA13, and GNAI2. Using a linear model, we compared the rates of aSHM in BL genomes from all clusters and identified the DLBCL-3 cluster to harbor the highest aSHM rates at common sites while the M53-BL cluster harbored the lowest rates. To further establish the biological basis of unique clusters within BL, we conducted differential gene expression analyses between the two major BL genetic subgroups, DGG-BL and IC-BL. We identified a total of 86 differentially expressed genes between the two clusters (p.adj \&lt; 0.01 and \textbar log2foldChange\textbar{} \&gt; 1). Among the genes with the strongest differential expression were IRF4, SERPINA9, and TNFRSF13B. Each of these are notable as their expression is a component of the DLBCL cell-of-origin and double-hit signature classifiers. Further, we found IRF4 expression to be one of the strongest predictors of cluster membership, with high IRF4 expression associated with IC-BL membership. Using TP53 and ID3 mutations as a proxy for M53-BL and IC-BL clusters in aBL, we found mutations in TP53 to be associated with significantly inferior progression free survival (PFS) at 2 year follow up, while mutations in ID3 were associated with overall better PFS at 2 year follow up.Conclusion: This work identifies novel genetic subgroups within BL with characteristic genetic and gene expression differences and some bearing relationship to DLBCL subgroups. The three subgroups with predominantly BL samples (DGG-BL, IC-BL, and M53-BL) each comprised a mixture of aBL and pBL samples, confirming similar molecular features in these entities. The IC-BL cluster is associated with mutations in ID3 and CCND3, high IRF4 expression, and ID3 mutated cases exhibited significantly better outcomes. M53-BL is associated with TP53 mutations and inferior PFS in aBL, representing a subset of patients to be considered for novel treatment approaches. These findings highlight shared pathogenesis between aBL and pBL and establish genetic subtypes within BL that delineate cases with distinct molecular and clinical features. This provides a new framework for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Figure 1Figure 1.

  abstract = {IntroductionPlasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare aggressive subtype of lymphoma. It is more common in HIV positive patients, and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and MYC rearrangements. PBL is characterized by markers of plasmacytic differentiation including CD138 and MUM1/IRF4, and loss of B-cell markers such as CD20, which suggests a cell of origin similar to that of multiple myeloma (MM) or activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The standard of care for PBL is CHOP-based chemotherapy but this is frequently not curative. Other than EBV-negative status, which defines a high-risk group, no other biological features have been discovered that are associated with outcomes.MethodsHere, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of PBL using a collection of 176 exomes and genomes (n=55 new, contributed by Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project [LLMPP] sites and centrally reviewed by the LLMPP pathology panel [WHO 2016]; n=121 previously published [PMID: 33225311, 33951889, 34465776, 34714908]), 65 transcriptomes (n=44 new; n=21 published) and 37 in situ single cell transcriptomic profiles (CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager) from archival diagnostic tissue biopsies. Somatic mutations (SNVs/Indels) were identified using an ensemble of four variant callers (Strelka2, Lofreq, Mutect2, SAGE). Salmon and DESeq2 were used to identify differentially expressed genes. This multi-omics dataset was compared to other known B-cell malignancies including 92 MM, 238 Burkitt lymphomas (BL), and 208 DLBCLs. Cell segmentation of the CosMx data was performed using Baysor and downstream analyses were conducted using the Seurat workflow. For functional validation, cell viability assays (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay) were conducted in the PBL cell line, PBL-1, and 4 control DLBCL cell lines.ResultsWithin the cohort, 63\% (106/169) of primary PBL cases were EBV-positive (EBV+) and 57\% (82/144) harbored MYC rearrangements (MYC+). When stratifying patients by EBV and MYC rearrangement status, mutations in different genes were enriched in each group: STAT3 occurred in 55\% (29/53) of EBV+/MYC+ PBLs; NOTCH1 in 19\% (7/36) of EBV+/MYC-; MYC in 24\% (6/25) and TP53 in 40\% (10/25) of EBV-/MYC+ tumors; TET2 was mutated in 38\% (9/24) and KRAS in 25\% (6/24) of EBV-/MYC- PBLs. EBV-/MYC+ tumors represented a subgroup of patients with dismal outcomes. The 2-year overall survival (OS) of these patients was 22\% compared to 61\%, 78\%, and 54\% of EBV+/MYC+, EBV+/MYC-, and EBV-/MYC- PBL patients, respectively (log-rank test p-adj. \&lt; 0.05).Consistent with previous studies, we observed recurrent mutations affecting JAK-STAT (STAT3, SOCS1, SOCS3, DUSP2) in 41\% of cases and RAS-RAF (NRAS, KRAS, BRAF) signaling in 38\% of all PBLs. In contrast to ABC-DLBCL, very few mutations occurred in the NF-{$\kappa$}B signalling pathway. Accordingly, PBL showed marked downregulation of genes involved in B-cell receptor and NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling. Consistent with the lack of reliance on these pathways, functional analyses in PBL-1 showed resistance to treatment to ibrutinib as well as PI3K- and MALT1-inhibitors. Moreover, constitutive expression of the I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} super-repressor did not affect viability of PBL-1 cells.In situ single cell transcriptomic data analyses showed a sparse tumor microenvironment (TME) in PBL, with the primary non-malignant cell types being, on average, 10\% macrophages, 7\% NK/T cells, and 4\% stromal cells of all represented cell types. EBV+/MYC+ tumors displayed a more abundant immune cell population with higher levels of macrophages (median 12\%) and NK/T cells (median 9\%), whereas EBV-/MYC- tumors were composed of the lowest levels of immune cells (median 4\% macrophages and 1\% NK/T cells). With respect to malignant cell phenotypes, we noted a novel population of SPP1-expressing cells that were enriched in EBV+/MYC+ tumors and a population of CD44-expressing cells that were enriched in EBV+/MYC- tumors.ConclusionHere we present novel subgroups of PBL with unique biology and clinical outcomes. We show that PBL does not rely on B-cell receptor signaling, instead relying on potentially targetable vulnerabilities in JAK-STAT, NOTCH, and RAS-RAF signaling according to EBV positivity and MYC rearrangement status. Lastly, we provide insight into the TME of PBL and demonstrate a novel population of SPP1 and CD44 expressing malignant cells in EBV+ tumors.},
