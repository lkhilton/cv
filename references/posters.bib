  abstract = {Introduction: High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (HGBL-DH/TH), colloquially referred to as double- or triple-hit lymphoma, is associated with poor outcomes prompting many centers to use dose-intensive immunochemotherapy. The benefit of treatment intensification in patients with HGBL-DH/TH with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) morphology, who would otherwise receive standard-of-care rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP), remains unclear because suitably powered randomized clinical trials have not been performed, and earlier studies included patients with high-grade morphology. Furthermore, selection bias due to the restriction of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing to diagnose HGBL-DH/TH in patients with high-risk clinical presentation or aggressive tumor morphology confounds historical comparators. Since 2015, de novo DLBCL biopsies in British Columbia (BC) have undergone routine FISH testing in clinical practice. Concurrently, provincial guidelines were introduced recommending treatment with dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisone and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) for appropriately fit patients aged 75 years (y) or younger with HGBL-DH/TH harboring BCL2 rearrangements with DLBCL morphology (HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL). A population-based analysis was conducted to assess the impact of the introduction of DA-EPOCH-R on outcomes in HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL.Methods: Outcomes of HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL patients diagnosed between 2015 to 2020 using clinical FISH performed on de novo DLBCL biopsies (DA-EPOCH-R era) were compared to patients with HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL identified from a historic province-wide cohort of de novo DLBCL diagnosed between 2005-2010 in BC that underwent universal FISH in a research setting (R-CHOP era). Patients with the rarer entity of HGBL-DH/TH harboring MYC and BCL6 rearrangements only (HGBL-DH-BCL6) were excluded and were not part of the original DA-EPOCH-R guideline. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to predict the independent effect of treatment era after controlling for the International Prognostic Index (IPI).Results: 99 patients with HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL were identified through routine clinical FISH in the DA-EPOCH-R era. Of 1172 de novo DLBCL patients in the historic R-CHOP era, 824 had adequate diagnostic material for evaluation by FISH, 52 of which were HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL. The analysis was restricted to patients aged 75y or younger, yielding 71 and 38 patients in the DA-EPOCH-R and R-CHOP eras, respectively. 7/38 (18\%) biopsies in the R-CHOP era had undergone clinical FISH testing at diagnosis with results known to the treating physician. Median (interquartile range) follow-up in living patients was 2.8y (2.0-4.4y) in the DA-EPOCH-R era and 12.2y (11.2-13.4y) in the R-CHOP era. 49/71 (69\%) patients received DA-EPOCH-R in the DA-EPOCH-R era, whereas 32/38 patients (84\%) received R-CHOP in the R-CHOP era. Both eras had comparable baseline clinical characteristics with no significant difference in IPI risk groups (Table 1). The DA-EPOCH-R era was associated with superior 2-year time to progression (TTP, 73.9\% vs 47.4\%, p=0.016) and overall survival (OS, 77.7\% vs 50.0\%, p=0.022, Figure 1). After adjusting for IPI risk groups (low 0-2, high 3-5), the DA-EPOCH-R era was independently associated with superior TTP (hazard ratio (HR) 0.41, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.77, p=0.005) and OS (HR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.21-0.76, p=0.005). After controlling for individual IPI factors, treatment era remained predictive of TTP (HR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.19- 0.76, p=0.006) and OS (HR 0.39, 95\% CI 0.19-0.79, p=0.008).Conclusions: Introduction of a provincial, population-based recommendation to use DA-EPOCH-R for appropriately fit patients aged 75y or younger is associated with improved real-world outcomes of HGBL-DH/TH-BCL2-DLBCL. The similarity between TTP and OS within each era suggests the high failure rate of conventional salvage therapy irrespective of frontline treatment, prompting further investigation of novel second-line therapies in this poor-prognosis population. Targeted capture sequencing to identify MYC translocation partners is underway, and the influence of the MYC partner on outcomes in both eras will be presented.Figure 1Figure 1.

  abstract = {Introduction: While sporadic in developed countries, Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is endemic in resource-limited regions. Given the one-year survival rates of 61\% (Mezger, The Oncologist, 2023), BL patients in sub-Saharan Africa could benefit from improved diagnostic methods, particularly those that facilitate the evaluation of new targeted agents. Recent work from our group has found that BL can now be divided into molecular subgroups based on mutations (Thomas, Blood, 2023) and into epitypes using DNA methylation patterns (Thomas, BCD, 2025).Nanopore long-read sequencing is becoming a robust and efficient approach to rapidly profile patient DNA samples for structural variants (SVs), simple somatic mutations (SSMs) and base modifications. Using the adaptive sampling (AS) technique, sequencing can be focused on regions of interest (ROIs). This technique has shown promise in application to germline genetics (Vermuelen, Nature, 2023) but its potential application to somatic conditions remains largely unexplored. We are evaluating the utility of this approach to obtain genetic and epigenetic data from relevant genomic loci to facilitate differential diagnosis and accurate assignment of BL molecular subgroup and epitype. We aim to create a diagnostic assay using AS coupled with an automated bioinformatics pipeline that classifies and subtypes BL to inform treatment and improve outcomes in resource-limited regions.Methods: To establish ROIs, we selected driver mutations and features identified as relevant to differentiating BL from other B-cell lymphomas (Coyle, Blood Adv., 2025) as well as distinguishing epitype (Thomas, BCD, 2025) and molecular subgroup (Thomas, Blood, 2023). These include 179 lymphoma genes, 3 oncogenic SVs, 127 regions commonly affected by aberrant somatic hypermutation, the EBV genome, the IGH, IGK and IGL loci, collectively 31.5 megabases.Initially, we simulated AS data for 9 BL genomes by extracting reads corresponding to ROIs with samtools from whole genome sequencing data (PromethION). To generate real AS data, we prepared 32 \textmu L of DNA library using the Raji BL cell line. Library preparation with 1.6 \textmu g of gDNA was performed according to the Native Barcoding Kit 24 V14 (SQK-NBD114.24) protocol. The library was sequenced on a single PromethION flow cell (R10.4.1 chemistry) for 25 hours in enrichment mode using our ROI panel. Enrichment, coverage and relevant AS metrics were assessed using samtools, bedtools, Mosdepth, custom R scripts and MinKNOW output files.To evaluate epitype classification, CpG methylation status was inferred from simulated AS data with Modkit, analyzed with custom R scripts and compared to ground truth labels. To explore 5hmC modification and hypomethylation patterns, TET2 expression was determined from RNAseq data (n=126) and analyzed using R scripts. To examine mutation differences between epitypes, SLMS-3 (Thomas, Blood, 2023) variant calls within ROIs from Illumina data for the same 9 BL genomes were used; these were normalized and compared using custom R scripts.Results: The top 6,000 5mC positions with the highest variance were able to accurately recapitulate patient epitypes. These positions had an average CpG methylation level of 49\% in HyperBL and 36\% in HypoBL. HyperBL samples showed more mutations than HypoBL, consistent with the ground truth. TET2 expression was significantly greater in HypoBL, suggesting more demethylation and higher transient 5hmC modification during demethylation.Regarding AS metrics, 4.7\% of fragments present were basecalled. A total of 1.7 million fragments were sequenced and 23.2\% overlapped a target ROI. Mean read lengths for on and off-target fragments were 7,065 and 690 bases, respectively, and the range of quality scores for these reads was comparable. Average coverage across ROIs was 67.9, with an enrichment factor of 79.3.Conclusions: Preliminary analysis of real and simulated BL AS data suggests that a limited feature set can support successful subgroup classification concordant with Illumina ground truths. Evaluation of ONT-focused tools to resolve SSMs and SVs is ongoing. Our preliminary results suggest AS has the potential to serve as a portable, high-throughput diagnostic assay to inform treatment and improve outcomes for endemic BL patients in resource-limited regions.},

  abstract = {Background: Most patients (pts) with DLBCL who experience relapsed/refractory disease following R-CHOP will do so within 24 months of diagnosis, but late relapses (\&gt; 2 years [y]) can occur and are typically associated with better outcomes. Pts with late relapse have lymphomas that share few mutations with the original tumor and may represent de novo DLBCL arising from a common precursor cell (Hilton et al, JCO 2023). It has been hypothesized that these pts have chemotherapy-naive disease and may be effectively treated with a second round of R-CHOP-like therapy. This approach has been adopted for many pts managed in British Columbia (BC), particularly those who are unsuitable for more intensive options. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate outcomes in pts treated with R-CHOP-like therapy for late relapse DLBCL in BC.Methods: The BC Cancer Centre for Lymphoid Cancer Database was used to identify all pts with de novo DLBCL treated with an initial R-CHOP-like regimen who developed late relapse (\&gt; 2 y from initial diagnosis) of DLBCL from January 2005 to April 2024 and received second-line R-CHOP-like therapy with curative-intent (typically R-CHOP or R-CEOP, in which etoposide is substituted for doxorubicin once maximum lifetime anthracycline exposure has been reached [Moccia et al, Blood Advances 2021]). Transformed lymphoma, PTLD, PMBCL, and CNS lymphoma were excluded. Primary outcome was time-to-progression (TTP). Other outcomes included overall response rate (ORR); complete response (CR) rate; progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS); and disease-specific survival (DSS). Survival endpoints were calculated from the time of relapse to: progression of lymphoma or treatment/disease-related death (TTP), progression of lymphoma or death from any cause (PFS); death from any cause (OS); or treatment/disease-related death (DSS). Pts with `intent-to-transplant' were evaluated for response, but time-to-event outcomes were censored at time of transplant.Results: 53 pts meeting all inclusion criteria were identified with a median age of 77 y (range: 52-89) at time of relapse. 30 (57\%) were male. Median time from initial diagnosis to relapse was 7.4 y (range: 2.5 - 15.9). 47 pts had biopsy confirmation of DLBCL at relapse. Cell of origin (COO) was GCB in 24/37 (65\%), ABC/non-GCB in 12/37 (32\%), or unclassifiable (1/37; 3\%), according to gene expression profile (11/37) or Hans algorithm (26/37). COO concordance with initial diagnostic biopsy was 24/26 (92\%). At time of relapse, in pts with available information, 80\% had stage III-IV disease; 53\% had poor performance status (ECOG 2-4) and 80\% had high IPI (3-5). 15 pts (28\%) started R-CHOP, with a median of 3 cycles (range 1-6) before switching to R-CEOP (n = 7), stopping for transplant (n = 4), limited stage (n = 2), or toxicity (n = 2). The remainder (n = 38) were started directly on R-CEOP. The median number of total cycles (R-CHOP and/or R-CEOP) was 5 (range 1-6), with 5 pts receiving consolidative radiation therapy. Four pts were treated with a limited stage approach. 19 pts (36\%) did not complete their planned treatment, with toxicity or intolerance (n = 12; 63\%) being the most common reason for early discontinuation. Most pts were not considered for transplant due to age or comorbidities. Six pts were intended for autologous stem cell transplant, with 5/6 proceeding to transplant.Response rates were as follows: CR 60\%, PR 11\%, SD 4\%, PD 9\%, non-evaluable/missing 15\%. With a median follow-up of 29 months (m), 2-y TTP was 55\%, 2-y PFS was 46\%, 2-y OS was 55\% and 2-y DSS was 67\%. Median TTP was 45 m (95\% CI 0 - 97), median PFS was 20 m (95\% CI 0 - 45), median OS was 39 m (95\% CI 13 - 65), and median DSS was 59 m (95\% CI 41 - 78). Outcomes were also assessed according to timing of relapse following initial therapy. Pts who relapsed more than 5 y from initial diagnosis (n=41) had a significantly better TTP than pts who relapsed between 2-5 y (n = 12) with 2-y TTP 68\% vs 11\%, respectively (HR 0.27 [95\%CI 0.11-0.64]; p = 0.003), despite comparable baseline characteristics. No difference in TTP was observed between COO subgroups (HR 1.14 [95\%CI 0.82-1.60]).Conclusion: In pts with late relapse DLBCL, a retreatment strategy with R-CHOP-like therapy is a reasonable option. This approach results in durable remission in a high proportion of pts, thereby avoiding the need for more intensive therapies, particularly in pts who experience relapse more than 5 y from initial diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The diverse pathways that are deregulated during the malignant transformation of B-cells have been identified for many of the common mature B cell neoplasms, but a comprehensive description of the driver mutations that alter the function of proteins in these pathways remains incomplete. Specific variants may be distinguishing features of disease or largely restricted to disease subtypes, while other variants may be more widespread between subtypes. Mutations that are prevalent in certain immune cancers can be found at a lower frequency in other subtypes, which can affect the relevance of targeted therapeutics. Manual curation of hotspots is crucial to minimize noise and enhance statistical power for detecting hotspots present at lower frequencies, as certain regions in the genome are more susceptible to sequencing artifacts and data sourced from multiple cohorts can be prone to batch effects. Through the integration of mutational variants between Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and by employing manual validation of mutational variants to reduce sequencing noise, it is possible to identify novel mutational hotspots within the two subtypes.Methods: Mutational hotspot analyses were performed on a combined cohort consisting of BL and DLBCL samples that had undergone either whole genome sequencing (644 samples) or whole exome sequencing (1996 samples), for a total of 2640 samples. Samples were sourced from a combination of in-house and external datasets, comprising 28 datasets in total. Simple somatic mutations (SSMs) were identified using four variant callers: Strelka2, MuTect2, SAGE, and LoFreq. Mutational hotspots and significantly mutated genes (SMGs) were identified from coding region variants with HotMAPS, OncodriveCLUSTL, and OncodriveFML using a consensus approach of 2/3 tools. The curation of hotspots is performed by manual inspection of hotspot loci from the automated generation of IGV snapshots.Results: A large number of SMGs and hotspots were identified due to the size of our analysis cohort. HotMAPS identified 180 genes at a q-value of 0.01, OncodriveCLUSTL identified 219 genes at a q-value of 0.001, and OncodriveFML identified 105 genes at a q-value of 0.01. A total of 106 SMGs were identified by at least two tools, with 35 SMGs identified by all three tools (Figure 1). Among these genes, only 10 have not yet been incorporated in the Cancer Genome Census which may be used to estimate the quality of driver genes returned by these tools. Comparing to our curated list of genes previously associated with either BL or DLBCL, 39 of the genes with two votes and only 2 of the 35 genes with three votes are novel. HotMAPS and OncodriveCLUSTL identified a total of 207 and 254 hotspots, of which 109 and 110 hotspots were identified in the genes called by two or more tools, respectively, with overlapping HotMAPS and OncodriveCLUSTL hotspots occurring in 65 genes. Of the coding SSMs occurring in genes with two votes, 13\% of hotspot mutations (HSMs) existed in both HotMAPS and OncodriveCLUSTL hotspots (Figure 2). Within the 207 hotspots called by HotMAPS, 177 (86\%) were supported by variants from genome and capture samples, with the remaining 30 hotspots (14\%) being exome-specific. Within these 207 hotspots, 160 (77\%) were identified in both matched and unmatched-normal samples, while 47 (23\%) were only identified in unmatched samples. Of the 254 hotspots identified by OncodriveCLUSTL, 191 (75\%) were supported by both genome and capture samples and 63 (25\%) were exome-specific. Both matched and unmatched samples contributed to 151 (59\%) of the OncodriveCLUSTL hotspots and 103 hotspots (41\%) were found only in unmatched samples.Conclusions: All but two of the 35 genes identified by all three tools have been previously associated with DLBCL or BL as driver genes, which highlights the robustness of using this suite of tools to identify novel driver genes and mutational hotspots. Out of the 106 genes identified by at least two tools, 39 have not yet been classified as driver genes and may be novel NHL drivers. Manual inspection of the hotspots identified by HotMAPS and OncodriveCLUSTL is performed to expand curated blacklists and whitelists of mutational hotspots to minimize the impact of low-quality variants and improve power for detecting hotspots with lower mutation frequencies.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Genome- and transcriptome-wide analyses continue to enhance our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer. In lymphomas, this has enabled the identification of hundreds of recurrently mutated genes, highlighting genetic heterogeneity and relationships both within and among clinical entities. While the growing availability of lymphoma genomic data sets can be leveraged to integrate genomic analyses into diagnostic testing and clinical trials, the ability to rapidly process genomic data sets in a reproducible manner serves as a barrier to this goal. To this end, we developed a suite of tools Lymphoid Cancer Research modules (LCR-modules) to facilitate the discovery of novel drivers and molecular features in lymphoma cancers and perform quantitative comparisons between disease entities. We demonstrate here how this toolkit enabled a meta-analysis of lymphoma genomic data involving genome-wide profiles of 3330 patients.Methods: We assembled a collection of whole genome, whole exome, and RNA sequencing data from a combination of controlled-access repositories and ongoing projects at BC Cancer. The scope of genomic analysis of mature B-cell lymphomas (GAMBL) project includes cell lines and patient tumors from all common mature B cell neoplasms, comprising a total of 4612 samples from 3330 patients. To facilitate the project, we developed a suite of open-source and custom bioinformatics tools (https://github.com/LCR-BCCRC/lcr-modules) that leverages the Snakemake workflow management system and includes lymphoma-centric modules for the discovery and annotation of common mutation types, analysis of B-cell receptor repertoires and discovery of novel aSHM targets and relevant non-coding mutations, and RNA-seq analysis with batch correction and normalization. Individual modules are configured to create an automated, scalable, and reproducible workflow that runs each step as dictated by the availability of new data. The cohort-level integrative analysis and comparisons across entities are handled by our custom R package GAMBLR, which facilitates open-ended data analysis and custom visualizations.Results: Simple somatic mutations (SSM) were detected using a workflow that utilizes four algorithms to identify high-confidence variants with validated default thresholds for filtering of germline variants and common FFPE-associated artifacts, allowing for processing of samples without matched normal tissue. This automated and reproducible workflow facilitated the discovery of novel genes significantly mutated across lymphomas and broadened our understanding of the scope of aberrant somatic hypermutation (aSHM) and other non-coding mutations. Specifically, HNRNPU, STAT3, TFAP4, RRAGC were found to be mutated at relatively low frequencies, and their presence is a distinct feature of certain lymphomas or novel genetic subgroups within lymphoma types (Figure 1A). The aSHM analysis and discovery of novel hypermutated regions is handled by a custom tool Rainstorm. As a result, we were able to detect sites preferentially hypermutated in a single entity, such as the transcription start site of BACH2, mutated at lower rates than the other common target sites but significantly more in BL compared to other entities (Figure 1B). Combining aSHM at target sites discovered using our toolkit with other genetic features allowed us to explore and establish novel genetic subgroups within Burkitt lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. SV analysis can be conducted using Manta, GRIDSS, and JaBbA modules with downstream processing in GAMBLR. In B-cell lymphomas, the most common SVs identified using the automated workflow were targeting MYC, BCL2, and CCND1. Unsurprisingly, the most common translocation partner among B-cell lymphomas was the immunoglobulin heavy chain, but the novel BCL6-FOXP1, CD274-BACH2, BCL6-RHOH translocations in DLBCLs and MYC-BCL6 translocations in BLs were identified, among others (Figure 1C).Conclusions: We present here the modularized workflow for scalable and automated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data and demonstrate that it can be successfully deployed across thousands of tumour samples for the discovery of known and novel lymphoma biology. This represents an important advancement in reproducibility that will facilitate clinical translation of genomic discoveries.Figure 1Figure 1. Grande:\hphantom{,}Sage Bionetworks: Current Employment.

  abstract = {Background: Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) represent a heterogeneous group of T-cell lymphomas that currently are classified by the presence or absence of ALK tyrosine kinase (TK) fusion genes (ALK+ or ALK-) and clinical presentation (systemic, cutaneous, or breast implant-associated). Two overarching molecular types of ALCL recently were discovered, defined by the presence (Type I) or absence (Type II) of a gene expression signature highly enriched for JAK-STAT3 activation. Fusions involving non-ALK TK genes occur in some ALK- cases, but the fusion landscape of ALCL remains incompletely characterized.Methods: Expert consensus pathology review was conducted in the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project (LLMPP). RNAseq was performed and fusions were identified using FusionCatcher. Here, we focused on recurrent in-frame coding fusions. Previously unreported fusions were validated by RT-PCR. Type I/II was assigned using a previously validated gene expression-based model. Genes with adjusted (adj) P\&lt;0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Overall survival (OS) was assessed for systemic ALCL, when available.Results: We evaluated 379 ALCLs (229M/150F; mean age, 56 y). Of 199 candidate fusions (excluding reciprocal events), 28 were recurrent and passed quality metrics. At least 1 of these 28 fusions was present in 150 cases (40\%).ALK fusions were present in 106 ALK+ ALCLs (all Type I; P\&lt;0.0001). Of these, NPM1::ALK was seen in 68/106 (64\%). Alternate partners (X::ALK) included ATIC (N=24) and CTLC, COL1A2, MSN, MYH9, RNF213, SATB1, TFH, TPM3, and TRAF1 (1-3 cases each). X::ALK was associated with older age (mean, 52 y) than NPM1::ALK (32 y; P\&lt;0.0001) and showed relative overexpression of 49 genes, including multiple activators of small GTPases such as CGNL1 (FC, 5.6; Padj=2.4\texttimes 10-6), SRGAP1, ALS2, DOCK1, and NCKAP1. ALK expression was similar in cases with NPM1::ALK and X::ALK and there was no significant difference in OS.Non-ALK TK fusions were seen in 17/273 ALK- cases (6\%), including TYK2 (N=9); JAK2 (N=6); and ROS1 (N=2). All were Type I ALCLs (P\&lt;0.0001). ALK- cases with non-ALK TK fusions overexpressed 38 genes compared to ALK- cases without TK fusions, including cytokines involved in the IL17 signaling pathway such as CXCL6 (FC, 12.5; Padj=4.2\texttimes 10-3), CXCL1, and CSF3.We then assessed the relationship between ALK- cases with non-ALK TK fusions and ALK+ cases by separately comparing each subset to ALK- cases without TK fusions. FC values for ALK- cases with non-ALK TK fusions were significantly correlated with FC values for ALK+ ALCLs over the set of expressed genes (R=0.54; P\&lt;0.0001). At a median follow-up of 32 months, 0/4 systemic ALCL patients with non-ALK TK fusions had died, while 30\% of those with ALK- ALCL without TK fusions had died, but this was not statistically significant (P=0.26). The other 13 ALK- cases with non-ALK TK fusions were either localized ALCLs or did not have outcome data available.Of 20 TP63 fusions, 17 (85\%) were TBL1XR1::TP63 and 3 were X::TP63. As previously reported, TP63 fusions were associated with poor OS (median OS, 10 months; not reached for other ALK- ALCLs; P=0.007).Four ALCLs had a novel NCL::UBTF fusion involving genes encoding the nucleolar proteins nucleolin and nucleolar (upstream binding) transcription factor-1. Four cases each had PARG::BMS1 and TNK1::GPS2 (the latter seen only in Type I ALCLs).Conclusions: This large consortium-based analysis of coding fusions further elucidates the molecular distinction between Type I and Type II ALCLs. Both ALK and non-ALK TK fusions were seen exclusively in Type I ALCLs, which we have shown previously are enriched for JAK-STAT3 pathway genes and correlate strongly with pSTAT3Y705 positivity by immunohistochemistry. These fusions were not identified in Type II ALCLs, which previous data suggest are associated with epigenetic alterations. ALK+ ALCLs with NPM1::ALK and X::ALK showed differences in gene expression, suggesting biological differences. Furthermore, ALCLs with non-ALK TK fusions shared gene expression features with ALK+ ALCL. Clinical fusion detection could enhance molecular classification of Type I and Type II ALCLs and may guide precision therapy.},

  abstract = {IntroductionApproximately 30-40\% of patients (pts) with DLBCL have refractory disease or relapse following R-CHOP. The majority of pts will experience disease progression or relapse early (within 1-2 years), although \textasciitilde 20\% experience late relapse \&gt;24 months (m) from time of initial diagnosis. Salvage therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been standard therapy for transplant-eligible pts, regardless of timing of documented relapsed/refractory (rel/refr) disease. Recent studies exploring the use of CAR T-cell therapy in primary refractory and early relapsed pts is challenging this paradigm. However, pts with late relapses were omitted from these studies. Interestingly, emerging molecular data suggest tumors of pts with late relapses exhibit significant genetic diversity from the initial diagnostic tumor, and may in fact represent unique biology (Hilton et al, ICML 2021). We aimed to evaluate outcomes in transplant-eligible pts with rel/refr DLBCL according to timing of documented rel/refr disease in a population-based setting to further explore biological and treatment implications.MethodWe identified all pts within the BC Cancer Centre for Lymphoid Cancer Database, age 18 to 75y, diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DLBCL treated with curative-intent R-CHOP-like immunochemotherapy between 2001-2020 with documented rel/refr disease. Only transplant-eligible pts treated with standard salvage immunochemotherapy with intention for hematopoeitic stem cell transolantation (HSCT) were included. Patients with incidental discordant bone marrow involvement with low grade B-cell lymphoma were included, but transformed pts and those with isolated central nervous system relapse were excluded. Pts were divided into three cohorts based on timing of documented rel/refr disease from time of initial diagnosis: (1) rel/refr \&lt; 12m; (2) relapse between 12 to 24 m; (3) late relapse \&gt;24 m. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from time of documented rel/refr disease and from the time of HSCT in pts undergoing SCT.Results225 pts meeting the stated eligibily criteria were identified. Clinical characteristics at initial diagnosis were as follows: median age 58y (range 19-72y); 70\% male; 46 \% IPI score 3-5. Timing of rel/refr disease from initial diagnosis was: rel/refr \&lt;12m, n= 145, 64\%; rel 12-24m, n=32, 14\%; late relapse \&gt;24m, n= 48, 21\%. 92\% of pts with late relapse had biopsy-proven relapsed DLBCL. Approximately 95\% of pts received a platinum-based salvage regimen, most commonly GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin) +/- rituximab (n= 200 (89\%). The overall response rate (ORR) to initial salvage therapy was 54\% (14\% CR, 40\% PR). Response rate to salvage therapy according to timing of rel/refr disease was as follows: rel/refr \&lt;12m 41\%; rel 12-24m 71\%; relapse \&gt;24m 82\%, with patients with later relapses having higher liklihood of response (p \&lt; 0.01). In total, 122 pts (54\%) underwent HSCT; 118 ASCT; 4 allo-SCT. The likelihood of proceeding to HSCT based on timing of rel/refr disease was significantly lower in pts with refr/rel \&lt;12m (p \&lt; 0.01): rel/refr \&lt;12m, 43\%; rel 12-24m 72\%; rel \&gt;24m 75\%. Pts who did not proceed to HSCT were treated according to the discretion of their treating physicians, with 9 pts proceeding to CAR T-cell therapy. 8 additional patients received CAR T-cell therapy post-SCT failure. The medium follow-up time from documented rel/refr disease was 5.8y (range 0.1-14.5y). The 5-y OS was strongly correlated with timing of rel/refr disease (p\&lt;0.001): rel/refr \&lt;12m 15.8\%, rel 12-24m 33\%, rel \&gt;24m 58.5\%. (Fig. A) The 5-y OS from HSCT in pts undergoing SCT was similarly correlated with timing of rel/refr disease (P\&lt;0.001): rel/refr \&lt; 12m 31.4\%, rel 12-24m 46.5\%; rel \&lt;24m 65.4\%. (Fig. B)ConclusionIn pts with transplant-eligible rel/refr DLBCL, response to salvage therapy, likelihood of proceeding to HSCT and OS are strongly correlated with timing of documented rel/refr disease. Pts with late relapses \&gt;24m after diagnosis have notably favorable outcomes, compared with pts who experience earlier relapse (rel/refr \&lt;12m and rel 12-24m), supporting emerging evidence that these patients represent a subgroup with distinct biology with greater chemo-sensitivity. These data support the early use of alternative therapies (such as CAR T-cell therapy) in pts with earlier relapse. Correlative studies to delineate the biological diversity of rel/refr DLBCL are underway.Figure 1Figure 1.

  abstract = {Introduction:Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B-cell cancer, characterized by translocations that juxtapose a potent immunoglobulin enhancer with the MYC oncogene. MYC translocations are also found in 10\% of tumors with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma morphology. When a BCL2 translocation is also present, these high-grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBCL-DH- BCL2) have poor prognosis. While sustained MYC expression can promote cell activation and proliferation, it also has potent and acute effects on programmed cell death, which cancer cells must overcome in order to survive. Identification and functional characterization of common mutations that cooperate with MYC are thus important for understanding its role in pathobiology.Methods:Patient samples were obtained from an ongoing meta-analysis of mature B-cell neoplasms including unpublished data from the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project. Simple somatic mutations were identified from whole genome or exome sequencing data using an ensemble of variant callers. MYC rearrangements breakpoints were identified using GRIDSS and Manta. All functional studies were performed in an EBV+ BL cell line (Raji). HNRNPU mutations were introduced into cells using IDTs ALT-R CRISPR-Cas9 system, clonally isolated, and verified by sequencing. Subsequent RNA-sequencing was performed. Knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed using an HNRNPU expression vector or siRNA targeting endogenous HNRNPU. HNRNPU eCLIP in HepG2 and K562 cells were obtained from the ENCODE project consortium. Differential gene expression was analysed with DESeq2. Peak-calling and individual crosslink sites were detected using PureCLIP.Results:Within the sequencing data, we noted that several RNA binding proteins were commonly mutated in BL and HGBCL-DH- BCL2. Mutations affecting HNRNPU were identified in tumors from 11.6\% of HGBL-DH- BCL2 and 5.6\% of BL patients. These mutations were predicted to be inactivating but, unlike conventional tumor suppressor genes, an inactivating mutation on the other allele was never observed. HNRNPU mutations were significantly enriched in EBV+ BLs. The gene product (hnRNP U) is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein that plays a central role in gene expression regulation.To understand their biological effect in aggressive lymphomas, we introduced heterozygous inactivating mutations in the most affected region of HNRNPU. Clones with confirmed knockout exhibited reduced expression at the mRNA and protein level. Through gene expression analysis, comparing the parental to two mutant lines, we identified 615 differentially expressed genes (358 downregulated, 219 upregulated). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed reduced expression of genes in several relevant pathways such as MYC, TP53 and DNA damage response. This was consistent with our observation of reduced MYC protein in the mutant lines. A role of hnRNPU-in MYC modulation was further in experiments when HNRNPU knockdown reduced and overexpression increased MYC expression. Overexpression of hnRNP U also resulted in cellular stress and a decrease in cell proliferation.Using actinomycin D chase experiments, we found that hnRNPU loss leads to reduced MYC transcript stability. Crosslinking immunoprecipitation suggests that hnRNP U binds directly to the MYC transcript in poly G tracts in intron 1. This region is predicted to fold into G-quadruplexes, a secondary structure that can be bound by hnRNP U. HNRNPU mutations are only observed in tumors with an intact MYC locus rather than those with a rearrangement in intron 1. Taken together, these findings suggest that the region of MYC upstream of intron 1 may be relevant for HNRNPU-mediated modulation of MYC.Conclusion:HNRNPU mutations are novel recurrent driver mutations specifically within MYC translocated B-cell lymphomas. HNRNPU acts as a modulator of MYC expression, and the most common mutations are predicted to negatively impact this role. We propose a model where HNRNPU mutations moderate MYC expression, thus buffering MYC-induced apoptosis and proteotoxic stress. Further experiments to explore the role of HNRNPU binding on MYC expression and the potential role in buffering the proteotoxic stress associated with MYC translocations are ongoing. Insights into the mechanisms contributing to disease will support ongoing work to establish in vitro and in vivo models for future therapeutic investigations.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of pre-B-cell development, the germinal center reaction as well as plasma cell differentiation. IRF4 has emerged as a master regulator of cancer-specific gene expression programs in various lymphoid malignancies. Prior studies uncovered a hotspot missense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of IRF4 (C99R) that alters the affinity of binding to specific DNA motifs and leads to disease-specific changes in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (Schleussner et al, 2023). The C99R mutations were also found to be recurrently detected in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) (Mottok et al, 2019, Noerenberg et al, 2023); however, its functional role in PMBCL pathogenesis remains unknown.Materials and methods: We introduced the C99R mutation into two PMBCL-derived cell lines (U2940, Karpas-1106P) by applying CRISPR prime editing. We then performed ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq analyses on our isogenic model systems (IRF4WT and IRF4C99R). We also analyzed single cell (sc) transcriptome data of nuclei isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues samples of primary PMBCL (n=4) with/without this mutation, including control tissues from reactive lymph node (n=2), and normal thymus (n=2).Results: A meta-analysis of publicly available sequencing data revealed IRF4C99R hotspot mutations in 29 out of 413 PMBCL samples (7\%), compared to only 2 out of 1,999 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma samples (0.1\%) (p\&lt;0.00001). To characterize the role of this mutation, we compared the global chromatin accessibility profiles between IRF4WT and IRF4C99R PMBCL cells by ATAC-seq and identified regions with commonly enhanced (1,334 regions) and reduced (2,796 regions) accessibility across the isogenic models. Specifically, in IRF4C99R cells, the accessibility of flanking regions at specific EICE- and canonical/non-canonical AICE-motifs were elevated but clearly reduced at ISRE motifs. The direct IRF4 binding to these distinct motifs was validated by IRF4 ChIP-seq. In line with these results, differential gene expression analysis revealed down-regulation of key regulators of plasma cell differentiation such as PRDM1 and interferon gamma (IFN{$\gamma$}) signaling-related genes such as TNIK in IRF4C99R cells, both genes were regulated by IRF4 at ISRE DNA motifs. Conversely, a key cytokine in PMBCL CCL17 (TARC) was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in IRF4C99R cells, as validated by qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Previous studies reported downregulation of TARC by IFN{$\gamma$} signaling, a finding that we reproduced by IFN{$\gamma$} stimulation experiments in our PMBCL models. Moreover, we showed that inhibition of TNIK abrogated IFN{$\gamma$}-mediated downregulation of TARC, demonstrating a mechanistic link between IRF4C99R and increased TARC expression. Finally, we found the receptor tyrosine kinase encoding gene EPHB1, regulated at both EICE and AICE motifs, was the highest upregulated gene in IRF4C99R cells (adj. p\&lt;0.01). Of note, the higher expression of both TARC and EPHB1 mRNA in primary PMBCL tumors carrying the IRF4C99R (n=3) compared to IRF4WT (n=63) were validated by Illumina Whole-Genome DASL assay.We next performed in vitro binding assays and found EPHB1 specifically interacts with the membrane-bound ligand Ephrin-B2. Functional studies showed Ephrin B2-mediated adhesion and migration were significantly increased in IRF4C99R cells. Moreover, we retrovirally engineered Eu-Myc mouse lymphoma cells to overexpress EPHB1 in an in-vivo syngeneic model. After intraperitoneal injection into C57BL6 mice, the cells with EPHB1 overexpression promoted enhanced tumor growth with increased infiltration of spleen, liver and thymus. Finally, sc transcriptome analysis showed significantly higher EPHB1 expression in primary PMBCL tumor cells with the IRF4C99R mutation (n=2, p\&lt;0.001) as compared to cases with IRF4WT (n=2), and the expression was rarely detected in normal B cells. Ephrin-B2 ligand expression was detectable in the endothelial cells of PMBCL tumors.Conclusion: Our findings highlight pleiotropic effects of the heterozygous IRF4C99R mutation leading to hallmarks of PMBCL lymphomagenesis including a plasmacytic differentiation block, upregulation of the key cytokine TARC, and providing a potential explanation of disease specific tropism through the Ephrin-B2/EPHB1 axis.},

  abstract = {Introduction:Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that predominantly occurs in patients with HIV or other causes of immunodeficiency. Frequent infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and MYC translocations have been described as major features contributing to the pathogenesis of PBL. Prior studies examining the genetic landscape of PBL have largely relied on targeted capture-based sequencing approaches. As such, the molecular features of PBL remain to be fully explored. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of the genomic landscape of PBL using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to identify commonly perturbed pathways.Method:Archival diagnostic fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue biopsies from 58 PBL tumours were accrued from Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project (LLMPP) sites, including 15 tumours from Ramis-Zaldivar et al., Haematolgica 2021. MYC rearrangements were identified by break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and rearrangement partner was determined in a subset of tumours from capture or genome sequencing data using structural variant callers Manta, GRIDSS, and Delly. High confidence somatic mutations (SNVs/Indels) were identified in data from whole-genome (n=5) or whole-exome (n=53) sequencing through an ensemble voting approach utilizing four variant callers (Strelka2, Lofreq, Mutect2, SAGE). Mutation frequencies in known lymphoma-related genes were compared to activated B-cell (ABC)-DLBCL (Schmitz et al., NEJM 2018), as the closest tumour entity in terms of putative cell-of-origin differentiation stage, to identify differences in genetic aberrations. Candidate somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified from exome and genome sequencing data, using CopywriteR and ControlFREEC, respectively, and high-confidence CNAs were determined using GISTIC2.0.Results:Within the study cohort, 81\% of patients were male with a median age of 59 years (range 11-88). HIV and EBV statuses were available for 47\% of patients and 95\% of tumours, respectively, with 49\% (13/27) of the patients being HIV+ and 69\% (38/55) of tumours being EBV+. MYC rearrangement was observed in 60\% (35/58) of PBLs, with IGH as the partner gene in 88\% (21/24) of tumours. The most frequently mutated genes were STAT3 (38\%), TP53 (22\%), NRAS (21\%), and TET2 (16\%), consistent with previous studies, however novel mutations were seen in DUSP2 (21\%), KLHL6 (16\%), and BHLHE41 (16\%). Recurrent CNAs included amplifications in 1q, whole gains of 7, 8q24, 11p12 and deletions affecting 4p16, 5p15, 10q11.22. While the mutational landscapes were similar between samples with and without a MYC translocation, the MYC-translocated PBLs showed more frequent amplification of 1q32.1. When stratifying by EBV status, STAT3 and SOCS1 mutations were more frequent in EBV-positive tumours, whereas TP53, TET2, KRAS, and  MMRN2 mutations were associated with EBV-negativity. In comparison to ABC-DLBCL, PBLs were significantly enriched in STAT3 and NRAS mutations, and lacked common mutations affecting the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway (eg. MYD88,\hphantom{,}CD79B, and NFKBIZ 3' UTR mutations). Mutations in genes that are frequently mutated in ABC-DLBCLs, such as those associated with plasma cell differentiation (eg. PRDM1) or a memory B-cell fate (eg. TBL1XR1), were also not mutated in PBLs. Finally, genetic alterations associated with immune evasion, such as deletion of MHC I and II and mutations in B2M,  CIITA, and CD58, were rarely observed.Conclusion:These data present a comprehensive overview of the genomic landscape of PBLs in a large cohort. We show frequent mutations involving the JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways, wherein the genetic landscape can be differentially characterized by EBV status and MYC rearrangement status. We show that PBLs are genetically distinct from ABC-DLBCLs, with absence of mutations in genes affecting the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway, immune evasion, and driving a memory B-cell fate.Slack:\hphantom{,}Seagen: Consultancy, Honoraria.
